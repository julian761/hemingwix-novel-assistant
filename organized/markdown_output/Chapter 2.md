### **Chapter 2**

#### **Scene 1 – The Queries**

The checklist was supposed to be a formality. Ned treated it like a scalpel. Under the fluorescent hum, he wrote each query in the neutral, anaesthetized language of audit work, but each was aimed at a nerve.

Davison leaned over his desk, scanning the draft. His brow furrowed. “Jesus, Ned. This is… aggressive. These aren’t questions, they’re indictments. They’re going to see this as hostile.”

“They’re material risks,” Ned said, voice even. “It’s our job to ask.”

Davison rubbed his eyes, pen tapping the margin. Finally, he initialed it. “Fine. Send it. But I’m noting for the record that you drafted these.”

The email landed in the `$miles’r Us` controller’s inbox mid-morning. He read it twice, then forwarded it to the CFO with *Need guidance* in the subject line.

Minutes later, the CFO walked the printout into the CEO’s office. “You’ll want to see this.”

Kent, in a crisp suit, didn’t look up until a phrase caught his eye—*EBITDA multiples cross-checked against market comps*. He set his phone down and read the rest.

#### **Scene 2 – The Summons**

His first reaction was irritation, quick and sharp. These weren’t rookie fishing questions—they were targeted.

Then came something colder. Whoever wrote them wasn’t guessing. They had the frame, maybe even the full picture.

“Get me the one who wrote this,” Kent told his assistant.

“The partner?”

“No. The one who wrote it.”

An hour later, Ned’s phone rang. The voice was low, clipped, South African vowels flat, consonants bitten off. “My office. Tomorrow. Ten. Bring the file.” *Click*.

Davison stared at him. “Who was that?”

“Kent.”

“*The* Kent?” Davison’s voice lifted. “What in God’s name did he want?”

“He wants to discuss the queries,” Ned said, feeling the cold drum of his pulse.

#### **Scene 2.5 – The Night Before**

They met at a bar in the financial district—brushed steel bar top, bottles lit from below, suits in every direction. Caleb had a bourbon in hand.

“I told my dad about your little predicament,” Caleb said, smirking. “His take? Don’t try to win the argument in the room. Win it before you get there. And know the answer to every question before he asks it.”

Ned sipped his drink. “That’s it?”

Caleb shrugged. “From him, that’s gospel. Said you should treat this CEO like one of those bets. Do the homework, then commit.”

Back at his apartment, Ned dug in. He read analyst reports on the dental industry, focusing on the wave of consolidation that was being called a "gold rush." The more he read, the cleaner the outline of the strategy became: find a fragmented industry, use cheap debt to buy small players, and then flip the whole package to a bigger fund. The `$miles’r Us` financials weren't just sloppy; they were a map. He felt a knot of intellectual excitement. Tomorrow wasn't about catching Kent in a lie. It was about seeing if the map led where he thought it did.

#### **Scene 3 – The Confrontation**

The `$miles’r Us` headquarters occupied a converted mid-century building. Inside, the reception area was busy but unfinished—boxes against one wall, half-assembled workstations along another. A young woman with a marketing lanyard walked past, and Ned’s eyes followed her for a beat too long.

A junior staffer led him to a corner office that commanded the view. Kent was behind a desk that could seat eight, the city skyline blazing behind him. He didn’t rise. Just gestured. “Sit.”

As Ned settled, Kent’s eyes flicked toward the door where the marketing manager had disappeared. He smirked at Ned. “I noticed you like the dress code here? There are perks to being in a growing business in this climate. I know what your firms are like. All beige walls and bad coffee. I don't think they have the same... benefits.”

Ned felt a flush of heat on his neck.

Kent picked up the printout, flicking it once with his finger. “So. These questions.” He tossed the papers aside. “You think you’ve found something clever.” His tone was greasy, indulgent, like a man explaining a card trick. “It’s simple, mate. We’re in the arbitrage game. We buy these sad little clinics from sad little dentists for four, maybe five times what they earn. We sell the whole lot to guys in bigger towers than this for ten times. That’s it. That’s the whole business.”

He leaned forward, enjoying himself. “The parties, the golf, the girls—that’s just grease for the wheels. You can’t put that on a spreadsheet, can you? It’s the cost of getting the deal done.”

Ned’s mind was racing, connecting Kent’s crude explanation to the technical details he’d read the night before. He found his voice, speaking almost to himself. “So the debt from the buyout… it stays with the clinic. And you use a service company, the DSO… that’s how you get the money out.” He looked up at Kent, the final piece clicking into place. “It’s just the spread. The whole thing is just the spread.”

Kent’s grin widened. He pointed a finger at Ned. “There he is. The light comes on. Took you long enough.” He leaned back in his massive chair. “So, Mr. Accountant, you see the game. Question is, you want to keep score from the stands, or you want to play?”

The offer hung in the air, thick with the scent of cheap cologne and expensive arbitrage. Ned thought of his cubicle, of Davison’s weary face, of the endless, soulless spreadsheets.

“I want to play,” Ned said.

### **Scene 4 – Back at the Office (Revised Dialogue)**

The fluorescent hum of the office felt different—flatter, duller. Ned sat at his desk, the neat grid of cubicles stretching out before him like a life sentence he had just commuted. The air smelled of recycled paper and quiet desperation. He stared at his monitor, but the numbers were just shapes.

Davison materialized at the edge of his cubicle, holding a coffee mug like a shield.

“So,” Davison said, his voice a low murmur that barely carried over the wall. “You had a productive meeting yesterday.”

Ned didn’t look up. He focused on squaring a pile of loose papers, turning them into a perfect, useless block.

Davison let out a short, dry puff of air that wasn't a laugh. “Got a call from Kent this morning. Said he was ‘impressed’.” He said the word as if it were a foreign object in his mouth. “To have a client poach a junior right off a diligence file… it’s irregular. Makes the firm look porous.”

He paused, waiting for a response that didn’t come. Ned’s silence was an answer in itself.

“Anyway,” Davison’s voice shifted, becoming colder, all business. He gestured toward the thick $miles’r Us folder on the desk. “I’ll take that off your hands now. I’ll be handling the file going forward.”

He held his hand out, palm up.

“I assume,” he said, the words clipped and sharp, “all your *concerns* about their material risks have been satisfactorily… addressed?”

The echo of Ned’s own phrase hung between them, a quiet indictment.

Ned looked from Davison’s outstretched hand to the folder. He didn’t say a word. He simply pushed the file forward with his fingertips, a silent, definitive transfer of ownership.

Davison took it. “Right,” he said, the single word stiff with finality. He turned and walked away, leaving Ned alone in the silence.

Ned looked at the empty space on his desk where the folder had been. It was no longer a collection of financial statements. It was a door, and he had just walked through it.
