# **Chapter 5: "The Club"**

## **Scene 1 – The Ask**

**T**he Keg felt different tonight. Ned sat across from Caleb in their usual booth, but the familiar space suddenly seemed too small for his expanding ambitions. The black card sat on the table between them like a promise, its matte finish catching the dim bar light.

Caleb was mid-story about office politics, something about a partner's nephew getting fast-tracked, but Ned's attention kept drifting. He found himself studying the other patrons—young professionals nursing beers, complaining about their bosses, trapped in the same cycle of resentment and small dreams he'd escaped just weeks ago.

"...so naturally, Davidson's pissed because this kid doesn't know GAAP from—" Caleb paused, noticing Ned's distraction. "Hello… Ned?"

"I need Josh's number."

Caleb blinked. "You need what?'"

"Sorry, bud. My mind's racing." Ned leaned forward, lowering his voice. "Text me Josh's number."

"Jesus." Caleb pulled out his phone, scrolling through contacts. "What's the sudden interest? Last time you saw him at my barbecue, you said he was 'aggressively boring.'"

"He's not boring anymore." Ned watched Caleb's thumb hover over the screen. "He's useful."

Something in Ned's tone made Caleb look up. "Useful how?"

"I need him to connect me with his boss. His dental practice—you mentioned Dr. Patel has a successful clinic, right?"

"Yeah, nice little setup in the Beach. Josh seems happy there." Caleb found the contact but didn't send it yet. "What's this about?"

"Business." Ned spun the black card in a circle on the table. "I'm taking Josh to dinner. Somewhere expensive."

"On the company?"

"On the company."

Caleb sent the contact with a tap of his thumb, but his expression had shifted. "Josh'll take the meeting. Kid's never turned down a free meal in his life." He paused, studying Ned's face. "You're different tonight. This Smiles'r'Us thing has really changed you."

"Different how?"

"I don't know? More..." Caleb searched for the word. "Calculating."

For a moment, Ned felt a flicker—the urge to deflect, to apologize. Then the feeling passed, replaced by something colder and more certain.

"Maybe that's not a bad thing," he said, pocketing his phone.

Caleb was quiet for a long moment. "So what's in it for Josh? And don't tell me it's just a nice dinner."

"Some kind of finders fee." Ned shrugged. "He helps me understand Dr. Patel's practice, maybe introduces me to other dentists he knows from school. I’ll find a way to make him happy."

"Sure. But how much is this finders fee, exactly?"

"Enough to make it worth his while." Ned actually didn’t know what he was talking about at this point. He knew money was being poured into finding deals and that was enough for him to make promises.

Something shifted in Caleb's eyes—a calculating gleam that hadn't been there before. "And for the guy who made the introduction?"

Ned smiled. "I don't forget my friends."

For the first time since Harry, Ned felt something other than resentment. He was on the hunt and had spotted his prey; he had purpose. The question was whether he minded how natural it felt to think of Josh—Caleb's cousin, someone he'd shared barbecue with—as prey at all.

He realized he didn't.

## **Scene 2 – The Recruitment Dinner**

Canoe sat on the fifty-fourth floor, its floor-to-ceiling windows offering a view that made Toronto look like an architect's model. Ned had booked the chef's table—not because he particularly wanted to watch the kitchen, but because it was the most expensive option on OpenTable.

Josh arrived fifteen minutes late, slightly out of breath, his tie askew. He was exactly as Ned remembered: earnest, eager, the kind of guy who still got genuinely excited about things. But tonight, Ned noticed other details—the way Josh's shoes were scuffed, the careful way he folded his coat. 

"Holy shit. This place is incredible." Josh slid into his seat, eyes already scanning the room. "I've been saying I'd eat here when I paid off my student loans. The tasting menu is like three hundred bucks."

"My first time too. Get the tasting menu," Ned said, signaling the sommelier. "And we'll do the wine pairing."

Josh's eyes widened. "Are you serious? That's like another two hundred."

"Yeah, man. Special occasion."

"Caleb said you wanted to talk business, but this is..." Josh gestured helplessly at the elegant dining room, the other patrons in their expensive clothes. “Caleb used to tell me how you two would get kicked out of bars in Uni. Time’s have changed\!”

"I got a new job. We're in the same industry now. Let's celebrate." The sommelier approached, a silver tastevin hanging from his neck. Ned ordered without looking at the wine list. "We'll start with a bottle of your 2015 Chassagne-Montrachet."

Josh waited until the sommelier left before leaning forward. "Okay, I'll bite. What's up?"

Ned rehearsed this moment during the elevator ride up. "I'm with a company called $miles'r Us. We're a dental services organization—we partner with successful practices to help them scale and modernize."

"I've heard of you guys. You're growing fast. Some say too fast." Josh's voice carried a note of something—envy? curiosity? "Must be nice, working somewhere that's expanding instead of just trying to survive."

"Expanding we are. And we're just getting started." Ned paused as the wine arrived, going through the tasting ritual. The sommelier poured with practiced precision, and Josh watched every movement like he was memorizing it.

"The question is," Ned continued once they were alone, "what about you?"

Josh's brow furrowed. "What do you mean?"

"This dinner is about you. I mean, how long have you been Dr. Patel's associate? Three years? Four?"

"Four next month."

"And where do you see yourself in another four years?"

The first course arrived—some kind of deconstructed beet salad with microgreens and foam. Josh poked at it uncertainly, clearly out of his element and not trying to hide it.

"In four years... I'll probably still be his associate. I'm taking some courses, should be doing bigger cases by then. Building up my patient base." Josh paused, something flickering across his face. "I mean, eventually I'd like my own practice, but the debt load for a startup is insane. And Dr. Patel's not exactly retirement age."

"So you're trapped."

Josh's fork stopped midway to his mouth. "I wouldn't say trapped."

"But you would say limited." Ned leaned forward slightly. "Look, I'm not just looking for an introduction to Dr. Patel. I'm looking for a partner. Someone on the inside who can help me understand what he really wants, what motivates him, what keeps him up at night."

"I feel like we’re in a corporate espionage thriller."

"I'm talking about a relationship." Ned pulled out his phone, showing Josh photos from the company Instagram—the yacht pictures, the golf trips, the black-tie events. "Hey. Check these out."

Josh scrolled through the images, his expression changing. "These are all company events?"

"Some business, some pleasure. But yes, company events." Ned watched Josh's face carefully. "You ever been to a Raptors game? Courtside?"

Josh choked on his wine. "Courtside? Those tickets are like five grand each."

"Company has a box. Lakers are in town next week." Ned let that sink in. "You get me a meeting with Dr. Patel, I'll take you to the game. You help me close the deal..." He shrugged. "Well, let's just say the company takes care of its partners."

The sommelier returned to refill their glasses. Josh stared into his wine like he was reading tea leaves, and Ned could see the exact moment calculation replaced hesitation.

"Sorry for being dense. I’m still not exactly sure what exactly you want me to do?"

"Nothing unethical.” Ned said realizing he wasn’t actually sure that was the right word choide “Just arrange a meeting. Tell Dr. Patel you met someone who works with practices like his. Someone who might have some interesting opportunities." Ned leaned back as the second course arrived—some kind of seared duck breast with cherry reduction. "The rest is up to me."

Josh took a large gulp of wine. For a moment, Ned thought he might refuse. Then Josh's shoulders straightened, and when he looked up, something had changed in his eyes.

"And if he says no to whatever you're proposing?"

"Then you still got a great dinner and a basketball game out of it." Ned smiled, but he was studying Josh's face, reading the hunger there. "But he won't say no. Trust me on that."

Josh nodded slowly, and Ned felt a familiar satisfaction—the same feeling he'd had when he'd first understood Kent's arbitrage game. The moment when all the pieces clicked into place.

But underneath the satisfaction was something else, something that might have been guilt if he'd allowed himself to examine it. Instead, he pushed the feeling away and raised his glass.

"To new partnerships," he said.

Josh clinked glasses with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm. "To new partnerships."

## **Scene 3 – Game Night – The Seduction**

**T**he company box at Scotiabank Arena was everything Ned had promised and more. Twenty seats with a private bar, dedicated servers, and a view that made the players look like titans. Josh stood at the window, drink in hand, watching the Lakers warm up with an expression of pure wonder.

"This is insane," he said for the fifth time, holding up his bright green cocktail. "What the hell is this?"

"Some kind of craft gin thing. The bartender recommended it." Ned introduced Josh to the other guests—a mix of young professionals, all with the same hungry, ambitious look in their eyes. "Josh, meet Marcus from Scotia. He's in commercial real estate. And this is Abe—he's our general counsel."

Josh shook hands, trying to process the level of casual wealth on display. Everyone seemed to know each other, talking about business trips to Whistler, summer places in Muskoka, investment opportunities in emerging markets.

"How does your company afford all this?" Josh asked as they took their seats.

"When you're growing fast, you can afford to entertain clients properly," Ned said. "More importantly, you can't afford not to."

"The optics matter," Abe added, settling into his seat with practiced ease. "Clients want to work with winners. This is how you project success."

The game started, but Josh found himself watching the crowd as much as the action. During timeouts, servers appeared with premium whiskey and sushi rolls. Everyone seemed relaxed, entitled to this level of treatment, as if this was just Tuesday night instead of a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

"So this is how you guys live?" Josh asked during the second quarter.

"This is what success looks like," Ned replied. 

Marcus leaned over from the row behind. "Josh, Ned mentioned you work at a dental clinic?"

"Associate dentist, yeah. East end."

"Smart sector to be in. There's a lot of capital flowing into healthcare right now.." Marcus’s eyebrows were raised and his smile filled with meaning that went entirely over Josh’s head. "Your timing couldn't be better."

Josh looked at Ned, who was deep in conversation with a young woman to his left but clearly listening. This all seemed orchestrated. 

Marcus continued. "Smart to get in early with $miles'r Us. They're about to blow up."

"In a good way," Abe added, catching Josh's startled expression. 

"Very good way." Marcus finished.

By halftime, Josh was three drinks in and asking pointed questions about the industry. "So how does it work? The acquisition process?"

"Depends on the situation," Ned said. "Sometimes it's a distressed seller—maybe an older dentist with no succession plan. Sometimes it's someone who just wants to focus on patients instead of running a business."

"What's the typical multiple?"

"For a good practice? Clean books, steady patient base, good location?" Abe shrugged. "Higher than anyone else will pay."

Josh absorbed this information with the focused attention of someone calculating possibilities. "And the original owner—do they stay on?"

"Usually. We're not looking to disrupt successful operations. We're looking to scale them."

The fourth quarter was a blur of expensive alcohol and casual discussions of seven-figure deals. The Raptors won in overtime, and the box erupted in celebration. As they filed out, Josh grabbed Ned's arm.

"When do you want to meet Dr. Patel?"

"Soon as possible."

Josh's grip tightened slightly. "I'll chat with him Monday. We have lunch together once a week." He paused, then looked directly at Ned. "Start thinking about other dentists I might know. I've got some good contacts from dental school."

Ned smiled, recognizing the hunger in Josh's voice—the same hunger he'd felt watching Kyle Barclay work his connections, the same hunger that had driven him to Kent's office. "That's exactly what I was hoping you'd say."

## **Scene 4 – After Party – The Hook**

The private club was hidden below the court, down a VIP elevator, marked *Guests Only*. Josh felt the thrill of being on the inside as they passed through the discreet entrance, nodding to a doorman who knew Abe and Marcus by sight.

Inside, the space was all dark wood and leather, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the harbor. Young professionals clustered around high-top tables, the men in expensive casual wear, the women in designer dresses that cost more than Josh's monthly rent.

"Jesus," Josh breathed. "What is this place?"

"Members only club," Ned said, leading them to a reserved table with bottle service already waiting. "Sometime Drake parties here. We bring partners to celebrate closed deals."

"Tonight we're guests of the bank," Abe explained, settling into the plush seating. "Marcus arranged it." 

“You guys are our most fun clients.” Marcus smiled.

“Prospective clients.” Abe shot back. 

The table came with its own server, a striking brunette who knew everyone's drinks without being asked. One of breasts jack-in-the-boxed out of her shirt as she bent down to hand Ned another bottle. She guided it back in with a quick and reflexive motion. Josh tried to play it cool, but his eyes kept wandering—to the bottles of Grey Goose and Macallan 18, to the carefully curated crowd, to the general atmosphere of casual wealth.

"You guys do this often?" Josh asked.

"Often enough," Ned poured drinks with what he hoped would seem like natural ease. "Fun, right?"

A group approached their table—more young professionals, all with the inebriated confidence of apex predators on their territory. Josh found himself floundering in conversations about real estate investments, startup opportunities, cryptocurrency plays. Everyone treated him like he belonged. He wondered if they noticed he clearly didn’t.

"You're in dental?" A blonde woman in a Hermès scarf seemed genuinely interested. "I don’t know a thing about the industry, other than I wish I owned a few practices right now."

Josh had no idea what a woman like her would want with a dental office. "Yeah, it's... there's definitely a lot of change happening."

"I'm in asset-based lending. We're seeing so much activity in your space." She leaned closer, and Josh caught a hint of expensive perfume. "You must have some interesting insights into practice valuations."

Before tonight, Josh would have mumbled something about patient care and tried to change the subject. Instead, he heard himself saying, "The economics are really compelling."

The woman's eyes lit up. "Exactly. Most people don't realize how recession-proof dental services can be."

As the night wore on and he lost track of how much he had drunk, Josh realized this wasn't just about Dr. Patel's practice—there was about an entire world he'd never known existed that was obsessed with dental financials. 

"When can we do this again?" he asked Ned as they waited for their Uber at 2 AM.

Ned smiled, but there was something coldly transactional in his expression that Josh was too drunk to notice. "Soon as you get me that meeting with your boss."

"Already planned," Josh said, swaying slightly and feeling motivated to be helpful. "I'm thinking about it strategically now. Dr. Patel's been stressed about the lease renewal, and there's this new corporate clinic opening up nearby..." He trailed off, realizing he was volunteering information he hadn't planned to share.

"Good intelligence," Ned approved. "See? You're a natural."

Josh beamed at the praise, missing entirely the self-satisfaction in Ned's eyes.

## Scene 5 – The Setup

The staff lunchroom at Dr. Patel's clinic was cramped but comfortable, medical journals stacked beside a coffee machine that had seen better days. Josh picked at his sandwich, watching Dr. Patel review X-rays on his tablet—a complex root canal that had taken most of the morning.

"The access opening was bigger than expected," Dr. Patel was saying, adjusting his glasses. "She says she doesn't want a crown, but she needs one. I told her we'd build the tooth up with composite for now. When her insurance renews in January, we'll schedule her for the crown."

Usually, Josh looked forward to these case reviews. Dr. Patel was a good teacher, patient with questions, generous with his expertise. But today, Josh's mind was elsewhere, still processing the previous night's revelations about the world that existed beyond their small practice.

“I told her not to chew heavily on that side. If the tooth cracks, she cant say she wasn’t advised.”

"Smart approach," Josh said absently. "Hey, Doc, I met someone last night I think you should talk to."

Dr. Patel looked up from his tablet, glasses sliding down his nose. "Josh, we've talked about this. I'm not interested in changing our supply vendors. We have good relationships with our current companies."

"No, not supplies. This is different." Josh set down his sandwich, trying to channel the confidence he'd felt at the club. "This guy works with practices like ours—successful, established practices—and helps them expand. Scale up without losing what makes them special."

"Scale up how?" Dr. Patel's tone was cautious, but Josh caught a flicker of interest.

Josh had rehearsed this part during his morning commute. "Think about it, Doctor. We're close to capacity. When Mrs. Henderson called last week wanting an appointment, the earliest we could fit her in was November. You could probably support two locations, maybe three, if you had the right partnership."

Dr. Patel set down his tablet. "Partnership with whom?"

"$miles'r Us. They're a dental services organization, but they're different from the big American chains." Josh was warming up now, remembering fragments of conversations from the night before. "They work with individual practices, provide back-office support, handle the business side so dentists can focus on patient care. It's like you still own your practice, but with corporate resources backing you up."

"And this person you met, he just happened to mention our practice?"

Josh felt a flicker of nervousness but pushed through. "I may have mentioned that I work for the best dentist in the east end." He forced a smile. "Guy seemed genuinely interested in meeting you. No pressure, no commitment. Just dinner and conversation."

Dr. Patel was quiet for a beat and a half; Josh could see the wheels turning. The practice was successful, but Dr. Patel worked sixty-hour weeks just to maintain that success. Half his time was spent on administrative tasks—insurance claims, staff scheduling, equipment maintenance, vendor negotiations. The idea of focusing purely on clinical work while someone else handled the business side was appealing.

But Josh could also see the wariness there. Dr. Patel had built something good, something he was proud of. The thought of losing control, of becoming just another employee in a corporate structure, clearly bothered him.

"Dr. Patel?" A masked dental assistant appeared in the doorway. "Your two o'clock is here. Robin. MOD on 46."

"Set her up in op 5, please. I'll be right there." Dr. Patel waited until they were alone again before speaking. "Josh, I'll be honest—I've wondered when one of these corporate groups would approach me. The practice is doing well, maybe too well for them to ignore."

"So you'll meet with him?"

Dr. Patel rubbed his eyes, suddenly looking older than his fifty-three years. "What would this meeting involve?"

"Just dinner. Informational conversation. No pressure, no commitment." Josh paused, remembering the previous night. "These people are serious operators, Doc. Professional. I think you'd find it interesting, even if you don't want to pursue anything."

Dr. Patel stood, straightening his lab coat. "One dinner. Somewhere professional—not some sports bar."

"I'll set it up," Josh said, already holding his phone, his pulse quickening with something that might have been excitement or guilt. "These guys will pick something nice."

As Dr. Patel headed back to his patient, Josh sent a quick text to Ned: "He'll meet. When and where? He said, *no sports bars*.”

The response came back within minutes:

*Perfect*  
*Scaramouche, Friday 7 PM*  
*Tell him we're looking forward to hearing about his practice*

Josh stared at the message, feeling a complex mixture of pride and unease. He'd delivered exactly what Ned wanted, but something about the speed of the response, the immediate assumption of success, made him wonder what exactly he'd set in motion.

He pushed the thought away. Dr. Patel deserved to hear about opportunities, deserved to know what was possible. And Josh deserved his shot at something bigger than being an associate forever.

Everyone would benefit. That's what partnerships were for.

## Scene 6 – The Closing Dinner

Scaramouche commanded the city from its perch atop Avenue Road, its panoramic view making Toronto's lights twinkle like a circuit board below. Ned had secured the corner table with the best sight lines, arriving early to ensure everything was perfect.

Dr. Patel appeared in the doorway precisely at seven, wearing a navy sport coat over pressed slacks—clearly his best attempt at fine dining attire, but still carrying the practical air of someone more comfortable in scrubs. Ned rose to greet him, noting the slight hesitation in the doctor's handshake, the way his eyes swept the elegant dining room with barely concealed intimidation.

"Dr. Patel, thank you for taking the time." Ned's voice carried just the right note of respectful deference. "I'm Ned, and this is my colleague Abraham, our general counsel."

Abe stood as well, his presence immediately elevating the encounter. Where Ned projected hungry ambition, Abe radiated quiet authority—the kind of man who belonged in rooms like this. "Doctor, it's a pleasure. Josh has told us wonderful things about your practice."

Dr. Patel accepted the handshake, clearly impressed despite himself. "Josh speaks very highly of your organization as well."

They settled into their seats, and Ned watched Dr. Patel take in the room—the other diners in their expensive clothes, the silent efficiency of the service, the general atmosphere of understated wealth. When the sommelier approached, Dr. Patel ordered club soda with lime, while Ned and Abe opted for wine.

"I should mention upfront," Dr. Patel said once they were alone, "I'm quite happy with my current situation. I'm not actively looking to make any changes."

"Of course," Abe replied smoothly. "We wouldn't expect otherwise. Successful practices like yours don't typically need to seek out opportunities—opportunities find them."

The conversation started professionally: changes in the dental industry, patient demographics, the challenges of running an independent practice in an increasingly regulated environment. Dr. Patel began to relax slightly as the discussion remained technical and respectful.

"The economics of dental care have certainly evolved," Dr. Patel said as their appetizers arrived—he'd ordered the most straightforward option on the menu, avoiding anything that might embarrass him. "Insurance reimbursements haven't kept pace with overhead increases. Equipment costs, staff salaries, rent—it all adds up."

"Exactly the challenges we help address," Ned said. "But I'm curious about your perspective. You've built something successful here. What keeps you up at night? What would you change if you could?"

Dr. Patel was quiet for a moment, cutting his salmon carefully. "Honestly? I'd like to spend less time on administration. More time with patients. And..." He hesitated, then continued. "I'd like to know that when I retire, there's something substantial to pass on to my children. Right now, the practice is essentially me. Without me, it's just chairs and equipment."

"That's a lot of pressure," Abe leaned forward, his voice carrying the weight of experience. "Right now, you're trading time for money. Very successfully, but it's not scalable. What we offer is the opportunity to build equity, to create something that generates value independent of your daily presence."

Dr. Patel set down his fork. "And in return, I become your employee?"

"Partner," Ned corrected. "You'd remain an independent contractor, retaining clinical autonomy while we handle the business operations. Think of it as having a team of business professionals working exclusively for your benefit."

"I've heard about corporate dentistry. Assembly-line treatment, pressure to oversell procedures, loss of professional autonomy." Dr. Patel's voice carried a note of distaste. "That's not the kind of practice I've built."

Abe nodded gravely. "Doctor, I understand your concerns. We've all seen examples of corporate groups that prioritize volume over quality. That's precisely the model we're trying to disrupt."

"How so?" Dr. Patel asked, but his tone suggested skepticism rather than curiosity.

"We're selective," Ned said. "We only partner with established, successful practices—dentists who've already proven they can deliver excellent patient care. We're not looking to change your clinical approach. We want to amplify it."

"The economics are compelling," Abe added. "Our partners typically see revenue increases of 30 to 40 percent within the first year, simply through operational efficiencies and expanded services."

Dr. Patel took a sip of his club soda, clearly processing. "What would that look like practically?"

"Well," Ned said, warming to his subject, "you mentioned equipment costs. We have purchasing power that individual practices simply can't match. Same quality equipment, better prices. Staff recruitment and retention—we have HR resources, competitive benefits packages, career development programs."

"And the administrative burden you mentioned," Abe continued seamlessly. "Insurance negotiations, regulatory compliance, financial management—we handle all of that. You focus on what you do best."

For the first time, Dr. Patel looked genuinely interested. "That does sound appealing. But I've built relationships with my staff, my patients. I wouldn't want to disrupt that."

"Absolutely not," Ned said quickly. "Continuity is crucial. Your staff would be offered positions with our organization—typically with improved benefits. Your patients would see the same doctor, same office, same quality of care. The only difference would be behind the scenes."

The main course arrived, and the conversation continued over perfectly prepared rack of lamb. Dr. Patel asked detailed questions about the transition process, the financial structure, the level of clinical independence he would maintain. His questions grew more specific, more engaged.

"You mentioned equity building," Dr. Patel said. "How does that work?"

"You become a shareholder in the larger organization," Abe explained. "As we grow, as we add more practices, your equity stake appreciates. Some of our early partners have seen their initial investment triple in value."

Dr. Patel's eyes widened slightly. "Investment?"

"Well, partnership implies mutual investment," Ned said carefully. "But we're talking about converting your existing practice equity, not requiring additional capital."

"I see." Dr. Patel was quiet for a moment. "And if I decided this wasn't working out?"

"Partnership agreements include exit provisions," Abe said. "Though I should mention, we've never had a partner choose to leave. Once you experience the benefits of our support structure, the idea of going back to managing everything yourself becomes... unappealing."

The conversation continued through dessert, but Ned could see Dr. Patel's resistance crumbling. The doctor asked about other practices in their network, about growth projections, about the timeline for expansion into new markets.

"I have to admit," Dr. Patel said finally, "this isn't what I expected when Josh mentioned dinner."

"What did you expect?" Ned asked.

"High-pressure sales tactics. Promises of quick riches. Corporate speak." Dr. Patel smiled slightly. "This has been... educational."

"We're not selling you anything, Doctor," Abe said. "We're exploring whether there's mutual benefit in a partnership. And that requires complete transparency."

Dr. Patel nodded slowly. "What would the next step look like?"

"Simple," Ned said, careful to keep any trace of triumph from his voice. "You send us your financials—last three years of statements, patient volume, basic operational metrics. We put together a preliminary proposal, no obligation on your part."

"How preliminary?"

"Detailed enough for you to make an informed decision. Financial projections, timeline, specific terms." Abe pulled out his business card. "If you like what you see, we move forward. If not, you've lost nothing but the time it took to review the proposal."

Dr. Patel took the card, turning it over in his fingers. "I'll need to think about this."

"Of course. Take all the time you need." Ned signaled for the check. "But I will say this—opportunities like this don't come along often. The market conditions that make these partnerships so beneficial won't last forever."

Dr. Patel nodded, clearly still processing. As they rose to leave, he shook hands with both men. "I'll have my practice manager send over the financials this week. Her name is Roxanne."

"We look forward to reviewing them," Abe said.

Outside on Avenue Road, Dr. Patel's car was waiting—a sensible Honda Accord that looked almost apologetic next to the valet's collection of luxury vehicles. As he drove away, Ned and Abe walked toward Ned's car in comfortable silence.

"That went well," Abe said finally.

"Better than well." Ned felt the familiar rush of successful manipulation, the satisfaction of reading someone correctly and exploiting that knowledge. "He's ready. He just doesn't know it yet."

"Josh earned his commission."

"Josh earned more than that. He's going to be very useful going forward."

As they reached Ned's car, Abe paused. "You know, six months ago, you would have felt guilty about what we just did."

Ned considered this as he unlocked the car. Six months ago, he would have seen Dr. Patel as a nice man being manipulated into a decision that might not be in his best interest. Tonight, he saw him as a business opportunity successfully cultivated.

"Six months ago, I was naive," he said.

## **Scene 7 – Everyone Wins**

**T**hree days later, Ned sat at his desk reviewing Dr. Patel's financial statements when his phone buzzed with a text from Caleb: *"Josh says you're a miracle worker. What did you do to him?"*

Ned smiled, thumbs moving quickly: *"Courtside seats, bottle service, fine dining. Just showed him what was possible."*

The reply came back immediately: *"He's asking about investment opportunities. Says he wants to 'diversify his income streams.' Since when does Josh talk like that?"*

*"Since he started thinking strategically,"* Ned typed back. *"Good for him."*

The truth was simpler and more complex than that. Josh had tasted belonging, and now he was hungry for more. He'd already sent Ned the practice's full patient database, highlighted which procedures generated the highest margins, and mentioned that Dr. Patel had been complaining about a new corporate clinic opening nearby.

More importantly, Josh had volunteered the names of three classmates from dental school who might be "interested in opportunities." One worked at a struggling practice in Mississauga, another was drowning in student debt at a high-volume clinic downtown, and the third was an associate like Josh, hungry for advancement but trapped by circumstances.

"Ned," Abe appeared at his cubicle, Dr. Patel's financials in hand. "These numbers are beautiful. Clean books, consistent growth, perfect demographics. Josh wasn't overselling—this guy built something special."

"Josh gets his first payment next Friday," Ned said. "Five thousand, just like we discussed."

"And Caleb?"

"Twenty-five hundred for the referral. Plus I told him we'd be interested in hearing about any other practices his network might know." Ned leaned back in his chair. "We're building a pipeline."

Abe glanced toward Zvi's office, then lowered his voice. "Have you told our fearless leader about Dr. Patel yet?"

"Tomorrow morning. After the financials are formally submitted and Josh confirms his three dental school contacts are interested in preliminary conversations."

"Smart. No point giving him time to swoop in." Abe straightened his tie. "You know what this means, right? You're not the new guy anymore. You've got your first independent deal, your own network of contacts."

Ned looked around the office—at the other business development guys working their phones, at the marketing team planning their next "dental conference," at the general chaos of a company growing too fast to maintain proper oversight. Weeks ago, he'd been a junior accountant cogging up a machine, dismissed by his father as a "middleman" only to be humiliated by Zvi's theft of the Harry opportunity and commission.

Now he was orchestrating a network of relationships built on money, access, and carefully managed corruption. *I’m fucking good at this*. He mused. *Josh was actively recruiting his former classmates. Caleb was sniffing around for referral opportunities among his professional contacts. Dr. Patel was...*

His phone buzzed with another text, this one from Josh: *"Dr. Patel is sending everything over. Also, talked to my buddy Mike—he's definitely interested in learning more. When do I get to come back to the club? LOL\!"*

Ned typed back: *"Soon. Very soon. And bring Mike next time."*

He realized, with a mixture of pride and something else he didn’t quite have a label for, that he was becoming exactly what this place needed. 

His phone rang—an unknown number with a 416 area code.

"This is Ned."

"Ned, hi, this is Roxanne from Dr. Patel's office. I'm emailing over the financial documents you requested. Three years of statements, patient volume analytics, and operational metrics."

"That's perfect, Roxanne. We'll have a preliminary proposal back to Dr. Patel by early next week."

"Great. Just let me know if you have what you need. He's looking forward to it. Between you and me, this conversation with you and your colleague really energized him. He's been talking about possibilities for the future of the clinic all week."

“Great to hear.”

“It’s like he’s his old self again.”

After hanging up, Ned opened his laptop and began crafting an email to the acquisitions team. As he typed, he found himself ruminating on the family dinner, his father had dismissing him as a "middleman," someone who "adds nothing" and takes a fee.

Arkady was wrong, of course. He’ll see that eventually. Ned wasn't taking a fee—he was creating value by connecting people who needed each other. Dr. Patel needed operational support and growth capital. $miles'r Us needed quality practices to expand their network. Josh needed opportunities for advancement and additional income.

Everyone won. That's what made it so elegant.

He finished the email and hit send, then leaned back in his chair with the satisfaction of a job well done. Outside his window, Toronto sparkled in the afternoon sun, full of opportunities waiting to be discovered by someone smart enough to see them.

Someone exactly like him.
