**Chapter 3**

**Scene 1 – The Acquisition Game**

The office was a testament to the principle that money moves faster than furniture. The air, thick with the scent of fresh paint and new carpet, buzzed with energy. Young men looking like they’d been plucked out of a consulting firm line up or boys week at a golf resort paced with phones pressed to their ears. Boxes of swag were piled up in corners and pushed to the side of each hastily erected cubicle. 

Ned’s desk was a slab of blond wood in the middle of this chaos. It was clean, empty, and felt like a temporary landing strip. He was straightening his keyboard for the third time when a shadow fell over him.

“Ned, my man. Zvi.”

The man extended a hand. He was tall, tanned, and wore a custom suit that probably cost more than Ned’s first car. His smile was perfect, practiced, the kind of smile that belonged on a billboard. He was the Chief Development Officer. “Kent told me you were here to interview for the new role as BD director.”

“Interview?” Ned responded confused. He was annoyed with Zvi’s presence, just long enough to become terrified that he had left his cushy gig at \[ACCOUNTING FIRM\]. “I thought I had the job as the new controller.”  

“Welcome to the circus,” Zvi said, his voice smooth as scotch. “You really want to work with the bean counters?” 

“Let us find some autistic lobotomized stiff for that position.” He perched on the edge of Ned’s desk, radiating the easy confidence of a man who had never once doubted his place in the world. He slid a piece of black plastic across the desk. An American Express Centurion Card. “Okay, here’s the first interview question: The limit on that card is whatever you need it to be to get a deal done. Your job is simple: get dentists to say yes. What are you going to do first?” 

Ned hesitated. “Well, other than the financials and my chat with Kent, I don’t really know much about this Company. So I guess I’ll spend a few days trying to understand the business, the industry, our value prop…”

Zvi cut him off. “Jesus Christ. You’ll be fired by tomorrow with that approach.” Zvi’s eyes wondered to a tall tanned man, around 28, who had just walked out of Kent’s corner office. Ned thought he noticed a little contempt or possibly jealousy cross his face. “Zvi’s gaze came back to Ned. “Try again.”

“My sister’s father in law is a dentist.” Ned said and paused to judge Zvi’s response. Zvi kept his eyes on Ned, waiting for him to continue. “I’ll call him.”

“Better.” Zvi responded. “And?”

“I’ll tell him I started here, and see if he wants to chat.” Ned said.

“No. And, what’s his name?”

“Oh. Harry. 

“Why would he want to talk to his daughter in law’s brother? What, are you inviting him over to the High Holidays?” Zvi retorted impatiently.

“No. I’m going to take him to his favorite steakhouse. I’ll find out what his plans are for his practice and see if he’d consider selling in in the next couple years.” Ned was guessing at this point.

“Great. There are some pretty girls in marketing–if you want to take any along. Find out what kind of wine Harry likes and have a bottle uncorked waiting on the table when he  arrives. Close the deal by the end of next week. If you don’t, I will.”

Zvi stood up, his gaze already drifting toward the next conversation. “Don’t get bogged down in the legal crap. The contracts basically say ‘You’re rich now.’ Plus whatever other terms it takes to close the deal.  We have a guy for that.”

As if on cue, a different figure ambled over. He looked a couple years younger than Zvi, with a friendly, lopsided grin that was made more memorable by a slightly crooked incisor. He wore a shirt that was a size too big and a tie that was knotted a little too short.

“A guy for that? Is that my official title now?” he asked with a charm. “Guess I’ll be needing new business cards.” He stuck out a hand to Ned. “Abe. General Counsel. Don’t listen to him about the card limit. I found it. It’s high, but it is not, in fact, theoretical.”

Ned laughed, a genuine laugh, and shook his hand.

“Good to meet you,” Ned said.

“You too,” Abe replied, leaning in conspiratorially. “Zvi wants singing ponies; I’m the one who has to write the pony choir clause into the acquisition agreement. Between you and me, I’m mostly just winging it.” He winked, a gesture so completely lacking in subtlety that it was charming. “It’s good to have another sane person around here.”

Ned watched Zvi glide away, already closing a deal on his phone. He looked at Abe, who shrugged with a comical sigh. In the span of two minutes, he had met his new boss and, he suspected, his first ally.

**The Lay of the Land**

The coffee shop across the street was an oasis of goth hipster serenity compared to the frantic corporate energy of the office. They found a small table by the window, the mid-day sun cutting across the tabletop.

“I’ve been here a year,” Abe said, stirring his latte with a little too much vigor. “It’s the most fun I’ve ever had. And the most terrifying.” He grinned, that crooked incisor giving his expression a slightly manic edge. He gestured with his spoon toward the street. “See that block? There are three dental offices there. We own two of them.”

Ned followed his gaze. One of the clinics they owned was a modern storefront with bright, cheerful branding. The other, however, was a shabby-looking brick building with faded lettering on the window. “That one looks like a dump from the outside,” Ned observed.

“Yeah. That’s a great practice,” Abe said without a trace of irony. “They keep overhead way down. I heard they even reuse their surgical gloves. Massive profit margin.”

Ned felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He was used to analyzing numbers, but hearing the cold calculus applied so nakedly was jarring. The knot didn’t linger. 

Abe took a sip of his latte. Ned overcame his insecurities and admitted: “I’ve never been in sales. How do you actually close a deal with these guys? The dentists, I mean.”

Abe took another sip of his latte, seeming focused on extracting the caffeine. Ned went on, thinking of his methodical plan, “I mean, obviously, you have to understand their pain points, their financials…”

Abe waved him off. “Let me tell you about Dr. Jeffrey Murphy.That clinic over there,” he said, pointing to the modern one. “Zvi walked in on his first day, according to legend anyway, and introduced himself . Found out the guy loves eighties rock. Zvi bought him a guitar signed by the guys from Van Halen. Murphy agreed to the LOI three days later at a prospect party. Murphy was so drunk when he shook hands, I was sure the deal wasn’t done. Lost $100 on it.”

“Huh,” Ned said. “That sounds like an expensive pitch.”

“It was—but all those expenses are 'below the line,'” Abe said. “I’m not an accountant, but anything “below the line” is basically considered free here.” He sipped his coffee.

“Nobody in finance said anything?”

Abe snorted. “Hey. Wipe right here.” He pointed to his own cheekbone while holding up a napkin. Confused, Ned wiped his cheek.

“Perfect,” Abe said, his eyes twinkling with mischief. “There was a little placenta left right there.” He chuckled at his own joke. Ned was thrown off for a second before a reluctant smile broke through. This guy was a little brutal. Ned was impressed. 

“Look,” Abe went on, leaning forward, “people in finance were pissed. Not because of the guitar, or the thousand bucks of tequila Zvi bought at the game, or any of that. They were pissed when they had to write his check for the massive commission he made on, like, day fucking one.”

“I’m starting to understand,” Ned said, the pieces clicking into place. The game wasn’t about saving the company money. It was about making yourself money.

“Shit,” Abe said, glancing at his watch. “I’m five minutes late for a call. Let’s go.”

They stood up, grabbing their cups. “Negotiating a deal?” Ned asked.

“No. We’re being sued. We bought a practice up in Barrie. Turns out the dentist was a total perv. Hit on a few of our marketing girls. Like, *really* wouldn't take no for an answer. We had to turf him.”

They pushed the coffee shop door open, the city noise rushing back in. “He’s suing *us*?”

“Makes no fucking sense,” Abe said, shaking his head as they jaywalked across the street. “We basically had to shut the clinic down. He kept his money”

“Damn,” Ned said. He felt a flash of recognition—a vague memory of a line item from his audit days, a sudden and unexplained revenue drop from a recently acquired clinic. It had been buried in the financials, explained away as a "reorganization."

As they reached the office entrance, Abe paused, speaking almost to himself. “Zvi was so pissed at Joe—he's one of the other BD directors you’re up against.”

“I’d be pissed too if someone on my team bought such a shit practice.”

Abe shot him a look, his expression suddenly serious. “Dude. Wipe right here, behind your ears.” 

Ned shot Abe a glance, saying “Hahah. Fuck off.” With his face.  

“That’s not why he was pissed. He was pissed because Joe got the commission. It was huge. Zvi wanted it.” Abe’s voice lowered slightly. “Look out for him. You need to have the dentist completely in the bag before you even announce you’ve got a lead. He’ll eat your lunch every time. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Abe clapped him on the shoulder and disappeared down a hallway, leaving Ned standing at his desk with the lukewarm coffee in his hand. The rules of the game were becoming brutally clear. It wasn't just a competition; it was a hunt, and his biggest predator was in the office right down the hall.

**Scene 3 – The Un-Hiring**

Back at his desk, Ned found an email from HR with a link to the mandatory onboarding portal. He clicked through a module on workplace safety, his mind still racing from the conversation with Abe. A video with grainy stock footage began explaining the proper three-point-of-contact technique for climbing a ladder.

*I guess you can't avoid this, even in the Wild West,* he thought, clicking "Next" without watching.

A blur of motion in his periphery made him look up. Zvi was hustling out of the office, phone to his ear, waving a quick goodbye to a few people on his team. "Got a tiger by the tail," he called out to the room in general. As he passed Ned’s desk, he paused, pulling the phone away from his mouth.

“Ned,” he said, his slick smile back in place. “Chatted with Kent. You got the job. Don’t stress. I was just joking about not closing the deal by the end of next week.” He clapped Ned lightly on the shoulder. “See you tomorrow\! Also, thanks for the lead. Ciao.”

And then he was gone, disappearing through the glass doors.

Ned sat back in his chair, a wave of relief washing over him, so potent it almost made him dizzy. It was followed by a colder, sharper feeling. *Thanks for the lead.* *What the fuck is he talking abou?* Abe’s warning echoed in his ears. *He’ll eat your lunch every time.*

On the screen in front of him, a quiz question popped up: “When using a ladder, you should always face away from the rungs. True or False?” Ned stared at it, the sheer stupidity of the question. He looked away from his computer just in time to see an attractive 20 something in a short skirt and heels, standing on top of a spare desk, stacking one of the swag boxes on a perilous tower of cubic cardboard. *Unbelievable.* Ned mused and clicked False.

**Scene 2, Beat 1 – The New Currency**

That night, the familiar gloom of the Keg felt like a refuge. Ned nursed a beer while Caleb listened intently, his eyes wide over the rim of his own glass.

“So Kent hires you as a controller, but Zvi makes you interview for a sales job, gives you a black card, threatens to fire you if you don’t close a deal by tomorrow, and then the GC tells you to watch out for your own boss?” Caleb summarized, a slow grin spreading across his face. “That’s a first day.”

“It’s weird,” Ned said, shaking his head. “The whole place is unhinged.” He pulled the black card from his wallet and placed it on the table between them. “He said the limit is ‘theoretical.’”

Caleb whistled, picking it up and feeling the weight of the metal. “Guess you’re paying from now on. My firm is super fucking uptight about expenses.” Caleb lamented. “I have to submit a detailed report if my Uber is two dollars over the estimate.” He slid the card back to Ned.

“Dude, this isn’t a business meeting,” Ned said, pocketing the card.

“It is,” Caleb said, his smile turning sly. “My cousin is a dentist.”

Ned paused, his beer halfway to his lips. “The neurotic dude from camp?”

“Uh huh.”

“He doesn’t own his practice, dude. He’s younger than us.”

“Whatever,” Caleb said, waving a dismissive hand as he pulled out his phone. “His boss owns a practice. Nice little spot in the Beach. I’ll get you his coordinates.” He began tapping on his phone, a look of focused determination on his face. “I get have the commission.”

“Buy your own beer then dipshit.”

Ned watched Caleb, earnestly texting with his cousin. A strange feeling settling in. For years, he and Caleb had been peers, commiserating about their soul-crushing but predictable jobs. Now, something had shifted.
