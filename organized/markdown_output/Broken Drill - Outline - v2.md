## ***BROKEN DRILL \- NOVEL SUMMARY***

***Genre**: Corporate Satire / Dark Comedy / Corruption Thriller*  
 ***Length**: Approximately 20 chapters / 80,000-100,000 words*

***Logline**: A socially awkward accountant's desperate need for acceptance leads him into a corrupt dental empire, where his transformation from outsider to monster culminates in the ultimate betrayal of his closest friend.*

***Summary**: Ned, a insecure junior accountant hungry for the acceptance his cold father never gave him, stumbles into the world of $miles'r Us, a private equity-backed dental rollup built on fraud and excess. Initially overwhelmed by CEO Kent's crude charisma and the company's culture of corruption, Ned finds salvation in his friendship with Abe, the smooth-talking general counsel who becomes his mentor, partner, and brother.*

*Together, they rise through the ranks over three years of escalating debauchery—cocaine-fueled business trips, escort-laden "conferences," and increasingly brazen financial crimes—all while their wives become best friends and their families intertwine. When a health crisis threatens to destroy the company, Abe attempts a coup to save it, but fails against Kent's entrenched power.*

*In the climactic betrayal, Ned chooses personal advancement over loyalty, framing Abe as the sole architect of the coup attempt. The destruction of his closest friend marks Ned's complete moral transformation from desperate wannabe to calculating corporate predator. The novel ends with Ned wealthy and powerful but spiritually dead, having learned that in a world without ethics, the only currency that matters is the willingness to destroy those who trust you most.*

***Themes**: The corruption of friendship by ambition, the hollow pursuit of belonging, the banality of corporate evil, and the cyclical nature of abuse and power.*
