Writing a Novel: Context For the Novelist

Here are some of my best tips on how to get your novel going on a sure footing and to feel good about your exciting new writing project:

### **1\. Set aside proper, regular time to write**

If you're serious about doing this, show yourself and your writing some respect, figure out some regular time to do it, and then stick to that. Writing a book is both amazing and also, at times, a difficult slog. It'll completely fall away if you don't keep it up. It's hard to hold your novel in your head, so that you can get down to work quickly and easily \- if you leave long gaps between writing sessions and work erratically, you'll be giving yourself a big uphill struggle and you're much more likely to give up.

What 'regular writing time' actually IS varies from person to person. It could be the famous dawn session that many people wake up to each day; it might mean grabbing an hour to write every afternoon while your baby sleeps, or taking your laptop or notebook on your train journeys to and from work. Perhaps you can manage three hours on a Sunday afternoon but not during the week at all.

For some people, *shortage* of time is not a problem \- but instead the challenge is to create structure in your time and find your focus. Here too, my tip would be to establish a workable and productive routine. Don't expect yourself to be able to write all day every day \- this can be very daunting. Instead decide on designated shorter time slots for your writing \- you'll probably find you can achieve more that way.

In general, my tip is to regularise your writing hours as far as you can \- stick to the schedule and make sure others around you understand that it's important for you to be able to do this.

### **2\. Don't expect your words to come out perfectly straight away**

Lots of people start off enthusiastically [writing a first draft](http://www.curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/how-to-write-the-first-draft-of-your-novel/), but then when they read over their material, they find it's not as good as they want it to be, and they just delete it all.

Try to go easy on yourself. If your internal editor gets too dominant, you'll spend your whole time deleting the material you've just written and you'll never get beyond the first page or two. It's better to just keep going and not look back too much for a good while. You can sort your prose out and make it read better later on, when you've got the rest of your story done.

Remember, great novels are made in the rewrite \- and very few writers would dream of showing anyone their first draft.

### **3\. Loosen up your writing and relax**

If the big white screen and the blinking cursor intimidate you, take yourself off-computer and try writing longhand in a notebook for a while. If the very idea that you're writing a novel is choking you up so the words won't come out, try to limber up with some free writing. By this, I mean just set yourself five minutes, or ten, to write down everything that comes into your head \- do it without stopping at all. This helps to lift the filter that sits between your head and your writing hand, and sets you up for the real writing (a bit like stretching before a run).

Writing to prompts can also be helpful. Just take an opening line that strikes you as interesting and see where it takes you. You can also use visual prompts, like a striking photo you've seen in the newspaper to write a short story. Here are some prompts you might like to try:

* Every night, when he came through the door, he thought maybe she'd be there.  
* She was small for her age.  
* Sam wondered what was inside the box.  
* There was no safety net.

[What kind of writer are you?](https://www.curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/all-writers-start-their-novels-in-one-of-two-ways-which-is-you/) When you start writing a novel, you will inevitably fall into one of two categories. I have a whole theory about this which you can read, along with my [tips to help you get going.](https://www.curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/all-writers-start-their-novels-in-one-of-two-ways-which-is-you/)

### **4\. Explore your ideas**

Write down everything you know about what you want your novel to be. Jot down little half-formed thoughts and ideas and see where they take you. If there is a burning question you want to explore, note that down. If you're fascinated by a setting or a time period or a subject, scribble notes about it. It's through these meandering jottings that ideas will take shape.

### **5\. Ask yourself 'what if' questions**

When you feel you've come up with a character who intrigues you, or a striking opening scenario or the vague shape of a story, interrogate your ideas with 'what if' questions.

For instance: There's a woman sitting alone in a restaurant looking sad \- what if a man comes up to her and asks if he can join her at her table? \- but what if she wants to be alone for a reason \- what could that reason be? And how will the man react when she turns him down? What if he thinks he knows her from many years ago ...? 'What if' questions can take you on a journey that builds story and plot.

### **6\. Get to know your characters**

Think about *who* your characters are \- not just what they do in the story and what their names are.

You might like to put together character fact files, create character 'mood boards' full of images which relate to them; throw your main characters into difficult difficult situations to see how they'll react; write some dialogue so you can feel their voices shaping up.

And think about what motivates them. Characters in a novel need to be so much more than chess pieces to be moved about the board according to your strategy.

### **7\. Alternate between plotting and writing**

While you're in the early pages of your novel, I'd advise you do a combination of working out the plot of your story *and* writing.

Figuring out your plot will help to give focus and purpose to your writing \- but conversely, feeling your way into the writing itself will help you to understand your story in a different and more visceral way. Each way of working should help you with the other.

### **8\. Work out your structure**

Once you're making some headway with your story and you're getting words down on the page, take some time to think about the structural features of your novel.

Will your story span a week, a year, a lifetime? \- and will you divide it up into short chapters or just a few long sections corresponding to years in which the action happens?

Will you have a first-person narrator who's looking back on the events of your story \- or is the story unfolding in the present?

Will you tell it in first or third person?

Making key decisions about structure and the means of telling your story can help you get off on a sure footing.

### **9\. Give yourself some targets to aim for**

This isn't for everyone, but lots of us like to have deadlines and goals. Perhaps you'll decide that you need to try to write 3,000 words per week \- or 1,000 words per day.

Maybe you'll go for some broader deadlines \- such as deciding that you need to be a third of the way through your first draft by Easter \- or by the time of your Summer holiday \- or have the whole of your first draft written by the end of the year.

Think of some deadlines and targets that feel realistic and achievable for you \- there's no point setting yourself up to fail \- and be ready to adjust and rethink if necessary.

### **10\. Don't worry about wasted time**

Lastly I'd say that nobody has a good writing day every single time they sit down to work. If you hit a tricky patch where the words just don't come, take yourself away from it and spend some time with your plotting and planning \- or print out what you've got and do some reading and editing. Or just go and read a good book to inspire yourself.

Sometimes it's precisely when we think things are going really well with a novel and we're producing lots and lots of words that we hit a stumbling block. It might mean there's a problem with your story that you have to solve \- but equally it could just be that your 'back brain' \- the bit that dreams up the story and controls the direction of travel \- needs to catch up with your front brain, where the writing of the words happens. (Disclaimer: I have no idea which part of your brain actually performs these separate functions\! This is just my way of articulating the way that writing happens ...).

If you're stuck, you just need the time to become unstuck. If you have to cut whole swathes of your work, don't delete them \- keep them somewhere safe. You may yet find they'll come in useful. Nothing is ever wasted \- not if you're smart about it.

# How to Write a Book: A Step-by-Step Guide

*by* [Natasha Khullar Relph](https://www.thewordling.com/author/admin/)

*I’ve written almost a dozen books, some in as little as two weeks. Here’s how.*

It wasn’t long after I became a full-time writer that I realized I was capable of writing a book. I’d written [**over 100 articles that first year**](https://www.thewordling.com/first-year-of-freelancing/), adding up to around 70,000 words. If I put that energy and motivation towards a book project, I knew I could [**finish a book within a few months**](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-write-a-novel-in-a-month/).

For a lot of writers, especially first-time authors, writing a book is a daunting concept.

It is, if you look at it as a whole. But if you saw your book as a collection of short articles or scenes, then writing it simply becomes a matter of doing a small section or scene every day and rearranging them at the end to make a coherent whole.

That’s exactly what I did and, over the years, I’ve [**written almost a dozen books**](https://www.thewordling.com/books/), some in as little as two weeks.

[Step 14: Decide how you’ll publish](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-write-a-book/#Step_14_Decide_how_youll_publish)

## The beginning

In this foundational stage of your book, it’s important to get clarity on what you’ll be writing, why you’re writing it, and how you plan to get to the end.

### **Step 1: Determine your why**

The most important question you can ask yourself before you begin work on a new book is why you’re doing it. What’s the goal here? Is it to build a career? To honor your family or history by sharing their stories? To improve your craft? Or, as was the case with my first book, to prove to yourself that you can?

Listen, writing a book can be a [**long and sometimes frustrating process**](https://www.natasharelph.com/give-up/). If you don’t know why you’re doing it, it’s easy to quit when you’re having a difficult writing day or you don’t know where to go next. Remembering why you’re writing this book in the first place can ground you and keep you connected to the project.

### **Step 2: Choose your book idea**

Your book idea and your reason for doing it are the cornerstones of any writing project. They guide your creative process and serve as the driving force behind the book’s completion. Here’s what you need to know about your book before you start writing it:

* **What’s the big idea?** Every book has a central, overarching theme or message. What’s the big idea behind your story? This concept will serve as the backbone of your narrative, influencing the characters, plot, and the ultimate impact of your book.  
* **Who is it for?** Determine the kind of book you’re writing. It is a first novel, a short story collection, a children’s book, or a work of science fiction? Identify your target audience—understanding who your ideal reader is will help tailor your story to their preferences.  
* **Why is it unique?** What makes this book different from the rest? Every project has a unique identity, and it’s important to get clarity on your vision for this book and what you hope it will add to the conversation or marketplace.

### **Step 3: Create space in your life for this project**

Writing a book takes time, and it takes space. You need to create the physical and mental space in your life to dedicate to this project, especially if you already have a full life with other responsibilities.

* **Creating time:** When it comes to finding time in your life for this book project, there are two ways I recommend. One is to simply decide on a non-negotiable hour or two in your day that you’ll be devoting to this book. Two, if your routine tends to run more flexible, is to slot hours in your calendar. Most writers will average 1,000 words of writing in an hour. Which means that in order to write the first draft of a 60,000 word book, you’ll need approximately 60 hours. Block off those 60 hours in your calendar for the next month or two before you even begin.  
* **Creating space:** Your writing space doesn’t need to be extravagant; it only needs to be comfortable and conducive to creativity. Some writers thrive in a cozy nook at home, while others find inspiration in the hum of a coffee shop. Establishing a designated writing zone, be it a desk, a corner of your room, or a favorite local cafe, can signal to your brain that it’s time to get to work. Make sure, too, that your writing space is [**free of any distractions**](https://www.thewordling.com/work-from-home/). Consider using apps that block off social media and podcasts while you’re writing.

### **Step 4: Outline your book**

If I were being simplistic and reductive, I’d tell you that there are two types of writers. There are the plotters who outline their book and often, to such extremes that they know every single chapter and scene before they write a single word. And there are pantsers, writers who know nothing about their story before they open a blank page and start typing.

The truth is, there are as many variations of that as there are writers. And often, whether you plan out a book or not will come down to the book itself.

I’m not a fan of giving new authors prescriptive advice about outlines. What I recommend is simple: [**get clarity on what you’re writing**](https://www.thewordling.com/the-elements-of-plot/) before you write it. This [**makes the process both easier and faster**](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-write-faster/). After all, if you don’t know what you want to say, how are you going to say it?

(Here’s my [**six-step process for outlining a novel**](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-outline-a-novel/) that pantsers love.)

Here are some ways to get clarity, both for the whole book and at the chapter or scene level:

* **Mind map your ideas:** Mind mapping can be an invaluable starting point since it allows you to brainstorm ideas and visually represent the connections between different story elements. Begin by jotting down central themes, characters, and plot points. From there, you can expand your mind map into a more comprehensive outline.  
* **Use plot templates:** If you’re new to book writing, seek out templates that provide simple steps specifically for designing or outlining novels. There are many methods to pick from—[**The 3-Act Structure**](https://www.thewordling.com/the-three-act-structure/), [**The Hero’s Journey**](https://www.thewordling.com/the-heros-journey/), Save the Cat, and [**the Snowflake Method**](https://www.thewordling.com/the-snowflake-method/). Don’t forget to look outside of Western storytelling for ideas as well.  
* **Character development:** Characters are a critical element of any compelling story. For new writers especially, it’s important to understand your characters, their backgrounds, motivations, and arcs before you start writing.  
* **Chapter outlines:** If you’re writing a nonfiction book, this is the point where you decide how to structure your book, which information will go in which chapter, and how long you want your chapters to be. For fiction writers, this is the plot. Consider your story’s climax, twists, and key turning moments.

### **Step 5: Set writing goals**

There’s a reason challenges such as [**NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month)**](https://www.thewordling.com/what-is-nanowrimo/) are so popular, even among professional writers who’ve been publishing for a long time. It’s because goals give you feedback on your progress and provide a psychological boost for getting work done.

The mistake most new authors is make is making writing a book one big goal. Instead, what you need to do is [**create mini-goals and milestones**](https://www.thewordling.com/set-writing-goals/) as you move through the project.

Some ways to do this include:

* **Word count goals:** Setting a specific word count target for a day, week, or month is a common writing goal. For example, you might aim to write 2,000 words a day, 10,000 words a week, or complete a 50,000 word novel within a month.  
* **Chapter or scene goals:** Instead of focusing on the daily word count, you can set goals to complete specific chapters, scenes, or sections of your project. This approach can be helpful for writers who prefer to break their work into manageable chunks.  
* **Time-based goals:** You can establish goals based on the time you’ll dedicate to working on this book each day or each week. For instance, you might aim to write for an hour every morning or spend weekends working on your book.  
* **Writing sessions:** Some writers prefer to track how much they’re writing through [**writing sessions or sprints**](https://www.thewordling.com/writing-sprints/). If you know you can write 500 words in a 15-minute sprint, then your target could be 4 sprints a day, which can feel far more achievable than 2,000 words a day.  
* **Research goals:** For nonfiction or research-intensive projects, you might set goals related to the amount of research you need to complete. This can involve reading a certain number of articles or books, or conducting interviews.  
* **Character or plot development goals:** For novelists, you can set goals to develop your characters or plot. This might involve creating detailed character profiles, outlining key plot points, or brainstorming subplots.

### **Step 6: Start writing your first draft**

This is where your book writing journey truly takes off. With your ideas, outline, and goals in hand, it’s time to dive into the actual writing process and [**begin your first draft**](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-write-a-first-draft/). But here’s something you should know in advance: if you’re struggling to begin, you’re not alone. Most writers, including successful writers who make a full-time living with their work, get intimidated by the blank page. The good news is that once you get started, the momentum you build will make it easier for you to keep going.

* **Write the first chapter:** Begin with your opening chapter. It’s crucial to hook your readers from the very start and introduce your story, characters, or topic. Remember, we’re not thinking about the entire book at this point. Simply how to begin.  
* **Know your audience:** Keep your target audience in mind as you write. What do they want or need from your book? Tailor your content to appeal to your ideal reader.  
* **Discover your writing style:** As you write, you’ll refine your writing style. It may be descriptive, concise, or somewhere in between. Don’t worry if you don’t have a well-defined style from the beginning. The key to becoming a better writer and developing your own unique voice is to write and practice more.  
* **Use writing prompts for inspiration:** If you’re [**facing writer’s block**](https://www.thewordling.com/how-to-overcome-writers-block/) or simply stuck on a scene or plot point, [**consider using creative writing prompts**](https://www.thewordling.com/creative-writing-prompts/) to spark some ideas.  
* **Use writing tools:** Good book writing software, like [**Scrivener**](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), can help you outline, organize chapters, and manage your research material.  
* **Embrace the rough draft:** Remember that your first draft is a rough version of your book. It’s not meant to be perfect. Give yourself permission to write poorly, with the understanding that you’ll revise and refine in subsequent drafts.  
* **Stick to the outline:** While writing your first draft, keep your outline or plan in sight. It’s your roadmap, and while you want to stay flexible, it will keep you from veering off course and introducing inconsistencies in your narrative.  
* **Avoid self-editing:** The initial draft is about getting your ideas on to the page, not refining every sentence. Resist the urge to backtrack and edit extensively during this stage.

## The messy middle

Navigating the middle stages of your writing journey can be like traversing a dense, uncharted forest—filled with obstacles and uncertainty. Let’s talk about how you can navigate this tricky terrain and emerge on the other side with your creativity and determination intact.

### **Step 7: Keep yourself accountable with mini-deadlines**

Maintaining accountability during the book writing process is essential to staying on track and motivated. One effective way to do this is by giving yourself mini-deadlines. These smaller, manageable goals help break down the colossal task of writing a book into more achievable chunks.

Deadlines are effective for several psychological reasons:

* **Eustress vs. distress:** Deadlines create a type of stress called “eustress,” which is the positive form of stress. It motivates and energizes you, pushing you to perform at your best. When managed well, eustress can lead to increased focus and productivity. In contrast “distress” is negative stress that can occur [**when deadlines are missed or unreasonable**](https://www.natasharelph.com/a-toxic-relationship-with-deadlines/), leading to anxiety and decreased performance.  
* **Parkinson’s Law:** Parkinson’s Law is the idea that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Deadlines impose a limit on your available writing time, preventing work from dragging on indefinitely.  
* **Focus and attention:** Knowing that a deadline is approaching can sharpen your focus and attention. It encourages you to [**stick to your writing schedule**](https://www.thewordling.com/work-ethic/) and concentrate on the task at hand, instead of being pulled into a million different distractions.  
* **Reduced perfectionism:** Deadlines reduce perfectionism by pushing you to take action and make progress rather than seeking unattainable perfection.  
* **Incentive and reward:** Deadlines also offer a built-in incentive system. Completing a task by a specific date often comes with a sense of accomplishment and the promise of rewards or avoiding negative consequences, such as penalties or criticism.  
* **Cognitive activation:** Knowing that time is limited activates your cognitive processes, increasing your mental alertness and problem-solving abilities. You become more aware of the importance of the task and what needs to be done to complete it.  
* **Self-regulation:** Deadlines require self-regulation, which means you have to manage your own behavior and impulses. Self-regulation improves as you practice meeting deadlines, leading to [**better self-control and discipline**](https://www.thewordling.com/productive-writers/).  
* **Sense of accomplishment:** Meeting deadlines gives you a sense of accomplishment and boosts self-esteem. This positive reinforcement encourages you to continue setting and achieving goals.

### **Step 8: Touch the book daily**

“Be ruthless about protecting writing days, i.e., do not cave in to endless requests to have ‘essential’ and ‘long overdue’ meetings on those days,” says bestselling author J.K. Rowling. “The funny thing is that, although writing has been my actual job for several years now, I still seem to have to fight for time in which to do it. Some people do not seem to grasp that I still have to sit down in peace and write the books, apparently believing that they pop up like mushrooms without my connivance. I must therefore guard the time allotted to writing as a Hungarian Horntail guards its firstborn egg.”

Listen to the master. Maintaining a daily connection with your book is vital for several reasons:

* **It keeps the momentum going:** Writing, like many creative endeavors, [**thrives on consistency**](https://www.natasharelph.com/consistent/). By touching your book every day, you establish a rhythm that can make the writing process feel like a natural part of your everyday life. It becomes a habit, reducing resistance and procrastination.  
* **It allows you to remain immersed in your story:** This is true, especially if you’re writing fiction. Daily engagement with your book allows you to stay in touch with your main character, your story, and your ideas. It keeps your mental gears well-oiled, making it easier to pick up where you left off without needing to reacquaint yourself with the details of your plot or your characters’ voices. This is essential for writing the best book you can as efficiently as you can.  
* **It keeps you making progress:** Connecting with your book daily serves as a constant reminder of your commitment to your project. You’re making progress, even if it’s just a few sentences or a paragraph. This can be incredibly motivating. It’s a tangible, daily affirmation that you’re moving closer to your goal of completing your own book.

Listen, touching your book daily doesn’t always mean [**writing thousands of words**](https://www.thewordling.com/writing-10k-words/). It can also involve thinking, planning, or researching. On some days, it might just be about re-reading your previous work or jotting down new ideas. The key is to keep that connection alive and not let too many days go by without engaging with your project. Whether you write one word or one thousand, daily touchpoints can be the difference between steady progress and falling out of sync with your book.

### **Step 9: Leave the voices at the door**

When you sit down to write, it’s important to leave behind the judgmental, critical voices that surface. These voices often take the form of self doubt or concerns about how your writing will be received. It’s crucial to recognize that these voices can get in the way of good writing and lead to writer’s block.

Many successful authors of bestselling books will tell you they’ve learned to enjoy the process of writing by embracing imperfections along the way. It’s important for them—and you—to embrace the notion that a first draft is a place for ideas, exploration, and experimentation, not perfection.

Understand that your initial draft is not a final product. It’s the raw material from which you will craft the final book. Remember, even a good writer can produce clichés or face challenges with word choices in early drafts. To write a great book, allow yourself to experiment and make mistakes, knowing you can go back and fix later.

## The finish

Reaching the end of the book writing process is an exhilarating milestone that every writer should experience. Let’s talk about the final steps you need to take, the sense of accomplishment that awaits, and what you need to do after you’ve typed “The End” on your manuscript.

### **Step 10: Finish the first draft**

Reaching this point in the book writing process is a significant milestone. To [**complete your first draft**](https://www.thewordling.com/finishing-your-book/), you’ll need to stay committed and maintain your daily writing habits and hard work. Don’t worry if your draft seems too cluttered or messy. This is a common feeling at this stage for most writers. The first draft is merely the beginning of the journey towards a finished book. Finish writing up the last of those words and don’t forget to celebrate your win once you’re done.

### **Step 11: Work with beta readers**

Now that you’ve finished the writing, it may be time to bring in some outside help.

The first thing you’ll want to do is read through what you’ve written and clean up the first draft so it’s coherent. Some writers will jump straight into a second draft at this point, especially if the first was the messy and rough version that I’ve been advising so far. More experienced writers may, however, produce cleaner first drafts. If that’s you, give it a look over and then send it to beta readers.

The reason I like beta readers to see my draft at this stage is so that I can get all the feedback about thin characters or subplots that don’t work before I’ve revised and polished to perfection. If I get notes suggesting I need to change major parts of the novel, then it makes sense to do it now before I’ve spent weeks on making every sentence sing.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when working with beta readers:

* **Assemble your team:** You want to find beta readers who are familiar with your genre or subject and will offer constructive criticism. While it may help to ask other writers, what you’re really looking for is people who like to read in your genre.  
* **Prepare your manuscript:** Address glaring issues, such as grammar and spelling errors, before you send your manuscript to beta readers. The goal is to receive feedback on your storytelling, characters, and overall plot, not writing tips, and you don’t want readers distracted by obvious mistakes.  
* **Set clear expectations:** Establish clear guidelines and expectations when approaching your beta readers. Tell them what aspects of your manuscript you’d like them to focus on, such as plot holes, character development, or pacing.  
* **Be open to feedback:** Keep an open mind. There’s no point asking for feedback if you’re not prepared to hear it. Every reader may have a different perspective, so consider how their feedback aligns with your vision for the story. Look for recurring themes or issues. It’s important to differentiate between personal preferences and genuine concerns that affect the quality of the work.

### **Step 12: Revise and edit**

“When your story is ready for rewrite, cut it to the bone. Get rid of every ounce of excess fat. This is going to hurt; revising a story down to the bare essentials is always a little like murdering children, but it must be done.” – Stephen King, New York Times bestselling author

The revision and editing phase is a critical component of the book writing process, ensuring that your manuscript is refined, error-free, and ready to captivate readers. In this draft, you’ll need to fine-tune your manuscript and focus on clarity, coherence and style.

Here are the areas you’ll need to focus on:

* **Novel structure:** Start with structural edits, which involve looking at the overall organization and flow of your story. Pay attention to plot consistency, character development, and pacing. Address any gaps in the narrative and ensure that the story’s progression is smooth and engaging.  
* **Character development:** Assess the depth and consistency of your characters. Ensure that they undergo growth and change throughout the story, and that their actions align with their motivations and traits.  
* **Dialogue and descriptions:** Are your characters’ conversations realistic and engaging? Are your descriptions vivid and immersive? Polish these aspects to create a smooth reading experience.  
* **Voice and style:** Throughout the revision and editing process, remember to maintain your unique voice and writing style. You’ll also want to refine your writing at the sentence level. Look for grammar and punctuation errors, awkward phrasing, and overused words.

### **Step 13: Hire a professional editor**

Regardless of how you choose to publish, working with a professional editor has become standard practice. If you’re planning on approaching literary agents with your work, they’ll want to see a polished and publication-ready manuscript and, of course, if you’re self publishing, you’ll need this, too. An editor provides an objective assessment of your work, free from personal biases or attachments. They can identify areas that may require improvement, even if it means suggesting changes you haven’t considered.

There are various types of professional editors, each specializing in different aspects of the editing process. These include:

* **Development editor:** This editor focuses on the “big picture” elements of your book, such as plot, character development, pacing, and overall structure. They offer guidance to strengthen your narrative and storytelling.  
* **Line editor:** Line editors dive into the nuances of your writing at the sentence and paragraph levels. They polish your prose, addressing grammar, punctuation, style, and readability. Line editors ensure your writing is clear, engaging, and free of errors.  
* **Copyeditor:** Copyeditors review your manuscript for grammatical and stylistic issues. They correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, and consistency in style.  
* **Proofreader:** A proofreader’s role is to conduct a final check for any remaining errors or inconsistencies. They review your book for typos, formatting issues, and other minor imperfections.

### **Step 14: Decide how you’ll publish**

Once you’ve finished editing your manuscript, you’ll need to decide how you intend to publish your work. The publishing process and the steps you take to bring your book to market will be different based on whether you choose the traditional publishing model or decide to self publish on your own.

Traditional publishing involves partnering with established publishing houses to release your book. While it can be a competitive and lengthy process, it offers the following benefits:

* **Editorial support:** Traditional publishers provide professional editing services, ensuring your book meets the high industry standards. That said, if you’re a first-time author, you’ll need to ensure your manuscript is the best it can be before you go on submission.  
* **Distribution:** They have established distribution channels, allowing your book to reach bookstores and libraries more easily.  
* **Marketing and promotion:** Traditional publishers often provide marketing and promotional support to help your book gain exposure. Do note, however, that it is mostly authors at the top who receive this support and if you’re a mid-list author with average sales, you may not get any marketing support at all.

In order to get a traditional publishing book deal, you’ll need to first, get yourself a literary agent. You do this by sending them a query letter and synopsis of your book. Once you have an agent, they will pitch your book and negotiate your contract (advances, rights, etc.) on your behalf.

Self-publishing, on the other hand, grants you full control over your book’s publication. Here are some advantages of going indie:

* **Independence:** You [**make all the decisions**](https://www.thewordling.com/self-published/), from book cover design to pricing, with no need for external approval. You don’t need anyone’s permission to publish your book in languages other than or in addition to English, as well as to bring out audiobooks. If you want to put your book in Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited, you can do that easily.  
* **Speed:** Self-publishing is a lot faster than traditional publishing, allowing you to release your book and start making an income sooner.  
* **Higher royalties:** Self-published authors keep a more significant portion of their book’s royalties.  
* **Flexibility:** You can experiment with various marketing strategies and adapt your book’s presentation based on feedback.

And that’s it. Once you’ve decided which road you’ll be going down, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get it in the hands of reader\!

Your first time attempting anything you value is fraught with risk. Most authors I know tackle their first novels with little more than hopes and dreams under the hood. Under these conditions, writing eighty thousand words can seem like an impossible exercise, and publishing those words remains an inscrutable business best left to the rich, the famous, and the extremely lucky.

And yet people do it all the time. Should you?

Before you jump the gun and publish a premature effort, learn what many authors wish they’d known before they started writing that book in the first place.

**Your first novel is a personal milestone but probably not a publishable product.** They say most so-called debut authors actually launch their careers with their fourth manuscripts, not their first. Like anything else worth doing, writing novels takes practice. Finishing your first manuscript is a huge creative milestone, but it’s probably not the book that’s going to get you published or earn you critical acclaim. Keep practicing; keep finishing manuscripts.

**Genre helps readers find you, and like you, and want to keep reading you.** New authors like to boast that their books are written for every reader, but that’s a stinker of a publishing goal. No book is for everybody—and if it were, that would certainly be an undiscerning group of everybodies.

Genre helps readers put a finger on the type of books they like to read. In contrast, a book written for everyone ends up appealing to no one. Genre isn’t designed to keep readers out; it’s designed to invite them in.

**Read the genre you write.** Reader tastes and expectations have changed since you were in school. The themes, pacing, point of view, and genre conventions that captured your imagination back then seem musty and outdated to readers today.

Books are an author’s business, and you better believe your market and literary knowledge should be expert level. The only path there: voracious, perpetual reading.

**Making a living writing is a business; know what you’re getting into.** Gone are the days when novelists were too delicate of sensibilities to dirty their hands with business matters. Even a traditional publishing deal today requires that you understand your book’s competition and marketplace. You’ll also be expected to initiate and manage some or all of your book’s marketing and promotion.

It’s up to you to learn the pros and cons of traditional publishing, vanity publishing, indie publishing, self-publishing, hybrid publishing, and all the other permutations various hucksters will be happy to take your money and book to handle “for you.” Understanding [today’s publishing paths](https://www.janefriedman.com/key-book-publishing-path/) is mandatory. Hone your business acumen to support your goals.

**Start with a stand-alone novel, not a series.** A paragraph or two doesn’t begin to give us enough space to explore all the reasons your first book should not be part of a series.

A series represents a serious handicap for a first-time author both in terms of learning the craft and getting sales off the ground. If your very first book falls flat yet it’s linked to a series, not only will nobody want to read the rest, but you’ll either be saddled with producing them anyway or explaining why they dropped off the face of the earth. Master the craft of writing novels and the business of selling them first, before you chain yourself to a series.

**Know story form and how to use it.** People who want to write have often been told their whole lives that they’re talented writers. But writing and storytelling are two different things.

No matter how gifted a writer you may be, if you don’t know what makes a story tick, you could find yourself turning out page after page of beautifully crafted prose without creating anything remotely resembling a salable novel—wasted time, wasted ideas, wasted dreams.

***Read more:** [Why story structure won’t squelch your creativity](https://www.lisapoisso.com/2016/05/30/writing-rules-outlining/)*

**Know narrative technique and how to use it.** On the other hand, if you can tell a tall tale but have no idea how to use the conventions of novel writing to get it onto the page—point of view, dialogue, exposition, world building, scenes, and so much more—you’re going to have a hard time creating a novel that will sell.

Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Just learn the craft.

**Know the mechanics of writing and use them effectively.** And then there’s all that pesky mechanical stuff: grammar, spelling, usage, punctuation, and more. If books are your chosen medium, you should probably get a handle on the conventions of the written language first.

Isn’t that what editors are for? Actually, no. Editors are for helping you polish your smartly-crafted, thoroughly revised draft. You wouldn’t want to end up paying an editor to rewrite or ghostwrite every book, after all.

**Know how to effectively and efficiently revise.** Writing your novel is actually the smallest and often fastest part of creating a novel. It’s what you do with your first draft that makes your creative seed grow and blossom.

Your greatest skill as an author is your ability to iterate and revise: your concept, your outline, your completed story, and finally your writing. Learn to revise at every level to make your story shine.

***Read more:** [How to revise your manuscript—first draft to final draft](https://www.lisapoisso.com/2019/01/24/revise-your-manuscript/)*

**Connect with colleagues.** Finding the right critique partner or writing group isn’t easy, so get started now. Look for groups where you can rub elbows with authors at all levels, from new writers to established authors; genre groups and organizations are best at this.

Don’t strand yourself in groups of aspiring writers where nobody knows the time of day. Seek out groups with members who are finishing books and selling them, not just talking about wanting to write.

**Get more practice.** Your first novel isn’t your first novel; it’s just the first one you finish. Every novel is an opportunity to learn something new about writing. Some novelists need more trial and error than others, but everyone needs development time. Get in there and practice.

Besides, nothing sells a first novel like having another on tap. Fans, agents, and publishers always hunger for more, so get cracking on the next title as soon as you’ve finished revising and polishing the first.

**Take ownership of your identity as an author.** No more of this “I’m an aspiring author” nonsense. You may not be a published author yet, but if you’re writing a book, you’re most definitely an author.

So start treating your time that way. Don’t get around to writing when the inspiration strikes; show up for yourself regularly and give yourself the opportunity to make this thing happen. Get serious about filling in the gaps in your knowledge about books, story structure, narrative technique, writing—all of it. When you [take your writing seriously](https://www.lisapoisso.com/2018/09/21/perfectionism-and-procrastination/), serious writing will start happening.
