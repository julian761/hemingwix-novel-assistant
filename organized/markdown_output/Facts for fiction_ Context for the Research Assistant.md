# **How I Did Research For 3 New York Times Bestselling Authors (in My Spare Time)**

**I’m going to talk about research. No, research is not very fun, and it’s never glamorous, but it matters. *A lot*.**

If you want to be able to make compelling case for something — whether it’s in a book, on a blog, or in a multi-million dollar VC pitch — you need stories that frame your arguments, rich anecdotes to compliment tangible examples, and impressive data so you can empirically crush counter arguments.

But good research doesn’t just magically appear. [*Stories, anecdotes and data*](https://copyblogger.com/storytelling-marketing/) have to be found before you can use them.

You have to hunt them down like a shark, chasing the scent of blood across the vast ocean of information. The bad news is that this is an unenviable task … but the good news is that it’s not impossible.

By the time I was 21, my research had been used by \#1 New York Times Bestselling authors like Robert Greene, Tim Ferriss, and Tucker Max. Was I a slave to study? Did I have to become a library hermit to accomplish this? No, I did it all in my spare time–on the side, with just a few hours of work a week.

Here’s how I did it …

### **Step 1: Prepare long before gameday**

In *The Black Swan*, Nassim Taleb proposes a test.

Someone walks into your house and sees your many books on your many bookshelves. Have you really read all these? they ask. This person does not understand knowledge. A good library is comprised in large part by books *you haven’t read*, making it something you can turn to when you *don’t* know something. He calls it: the Anti-Library.   
   
I remember once in college, the pride I felt about being able to write [*an entire research paper*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-holiday/spartan-system_b_1556462.html) with stuff from my own anti-library. We all have books and papers that we haven’t read yet. Instead of feeling guilty, you should see them as an opportunity: know they’re available to you if you ever need them.   
   
When I met Robert Greene and he asked me to become his research assistant, the only thing that changed was that I started getting paid.

I’d already [*marked and organized hundreds of books*](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/14/read-to-lead-the-secret-code-for-cracking-tough-books-and-reading-above-your-level/) with interesting leads and material and many other relevant books I had yet to get to. I had a Delicious account with countless links to articles and pages that might “someday” be of use. I’d been practicing on my own by researching examples of some of the famous laws in his books *after* they’d been published — in case I ever got called up to the big leagues.

This is the mark you must aim for as a researcher, to not only have enough material — and to know where the rest of what you haven’t read will be located — on hand to do your work. You must build a library *and* an anti-library now … before you have an emergency presentation or a shot at a popular guest post.

Google is great, don’t get me wrong, but you’re screwed if you haven’t prepared beforehand.

### **Step 2: Learn to search (Google) like a pro**

How do you find a needle in haystack? Get rid of the extra hay.

What seems like an overwhelming mass of information is often mostly noise. Eliminate it. Take a tip I learned from Tim Ferriss. When he was researching for the secrets behind health and diet, he used a few specific hacks to drastically reduce the search area he needed to cover.

For example, if he was looking for a high level athlete, he’d go on Wikipedia and find the world’s first and second-best athletes in that sport from a *decade ago*. Why? It meant there would be plenty of available material and unlike athletes currently on top of the world, these would be willing and available to talk.

He’d search Google with phrases like “\[My closest city\] \[sport\] \[‘Olympian’ or ‘world champion’ or ‘world record’\]” A search for “San Francisco bobsled Olympian” might get him a recently retired team doctor — the perfect lead to start with.

In other words, don’t look for just any needle in your haystack of choice. Look for the *right* needle.  
   
Me, I like to look for phrases, in order to find unlikely subjects.

Let’s say you were looking to talk about a great fighter pilot — not some legendary WWII figure but someone current, relevant to today. You’re not in the military, how are you supposed to find this guy? I like to think about it from the perspective of the writers who came before me, how would they have described the person I’m trying to find? What superlatives would they use? Probably stuff like “The Last Ace,” “Living Aces,” or “America’s greatest living airman.”

You’re looking for words that will appear in a profile or even in the headline of an article about the person you are looking to find, so that you can troll LexisNexis, Google News Archive, and even Google itself to find that person.

The phrase “The Last Ace,” as it turns out, happens to be the title of a fantastic article in *The Atlantic* by Mark Bowden and now you’ve got your fighter pilot (and one of the main subjects of [*Robert Greene’s new book*](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/0670024961)).

### **Step 3: Go down the rabbit hole (embrace serendipity)**

A couple years ago, I was contributing to a project and needed to make an analogy to mountain climbing — about a climber’s feel for the mountain.

Well, I don’t know anything about rock climbing. But I did remember seeing a commercial once with the founder of Patagonia talking about how he loved it. I found my example but decided to take a chance with something more: buried in the founder’s Wikipedia page was a mention of his friend, a named Fred Beckey. Who is he? I had no idea, but I started reading about him and it turns out he was awesome. And he led me to another climber, who ended up supplying me with the perfect quote.  
   
You have to embrace the accidental.

In researching [*my own book*](http://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/159184553X), which was sold to Penguin for [*a major, six-figure advance*](http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/24-year-old-marketing-director-lands-major-book-deal_b42516), I read nearly everything I could find about the history and ecology of media. But that’s not where I found my best material.

In a book about media (and my own personal experiences) I somehow made my strongest citations from *Ender’s Game*, *The Long Goodbye* by Raymond Chandler, *All the King’s Men* by Robert Penn Warren, *Status Anxiety* by Alain de Botton, and a handful of other books.

Directly, these books had nothing to do with what I was writing about, but because my mind was primed to [*see connections*](https://copyblogger.com/content-success/), I found them in the most unusual places.  
   
I can’t tell you how many leads I’ve tracked down from random Wikipedia citations. Explore what you’re curious about and know, and let it lead you to what you don’t.

One of my rules as a reader is to read one book mentioned in or cited in every book that I read. It not only solves the problem of ‘what to read next’ but it sends you on a journey down the rabbit hole.   
 

### **Step 4: When in doubt, turn to the classics**

Remember, there is nothing new under the sun. And if we’re all just saying the same things with new words, what quote is going to have more authority: one from Tacitus or some flavor-of-the-month blogger?

For me, when I research, the blank icon of an out of print book on Amazon is a clue not just that I have found something unlikely to have been overused by others, but something I can mold to my purposes (plus they only cost like $.01\!).

There’s a character in Murakami’s *Norwegian Wood* who wouldn’t read books unless the author had been dead for 30 years. That’s a little ridiculous, but it’s a start.

The Classics are “classic” for a reason. They’ve survived the test of time. Consider it the survivorship bias put to your advantage. Von Clausewitz once said that military historians love to cite Greek and Roman history because, as the oldest and most obscure, it is the easiest to manipulate. I don’t see that as an admonishment, I see it as a helpful suggestion from a master of persuasion.  

### **Step 5: Keep a commonplace book**

While researching [*an article I wrote for Tim Ferriss’s blog*](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/10/19/michel-de-montaigne/), I discovered (and subsequently borrowed) a tool used by the famous essayist and experimenter Montaigne.

Montaigne kept what he called a “common place book” — a book of quotes, sentences, metaphors and  miscellany that he could use at a moment’s notice. I keep a more modern — but still analog — version of this book. I write everything down on 4×6 note cards, which I file in boxes. (You could do this digitally, I suppose, but the physical arrangement — being able to lay them out on a desk — is critical to my work)  
   
This means marking everything you think is interesting, transcribing it and organizing it. As a researcher, you’re as rich as your database. Not only in being able to pull something out at a moment’s notice, but that that something gives you a starting point with which to make powerful connections. As cards about the same theme begin to accumulate, you’ll know you’re onto a big or important idea.   
   
For me, I have two book ideas percolating, each about 200 index cards full. Will something come of them? I don’t know, it depends on how many more connections I make, how many random coincidences align to bring those connections to light.

All I know is that my last book (close to 1,000 cards) came together this way.

### **Why research?**

###  Maybe you’re not a writer or a blogger. But, we’ve all found ourselves in a position where we need to convince people to do things they are not inclined to do.

When force is not an option, what do we do? We use the next best thing: [*persuasion*](https://copyblogger.com/persuasive-writing/). And when it comes to persuasion stories are important.

Anecdotes are persuasive.

Data dominates.

These things do not appear from thin air, or fall in our lap. We must search for them like a professional.   
   
But as I’ve shown, this doesn’t need to consume your life. It can be done efficiently and expertly by focusing our efforts on the right levers. With preparation, we lengthen our runway. By eliminating noise, we drastically reduce the size of the search. With serendipity, we set ourselves up to be lucky and by relying on the classics, we give our arguments more weight. And by organizing and collecting this information properly, it is there wherever (and whenever) we need it.   
   
Even if our research isn’t used today — or even tomorrow — it can still have immense value for us throughout our lives. I’ll leave you with Seneca’s persuasive case for noting, repeating and memorizing material …  
 

*My advice is really this: what we hear the philosophers saying and what we find in their writings should be applied in our pursuit of the happy life. We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application — not far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech — and learn them so well that words become works.*

# ***How to be a kick-ass writers’ assistant***

***On [June 2, 2014](https://buchnotes.com/2014/06/02/how-to-be-a-kick-ass-writers-assistant/) By [Eric Buchman](https://buchnotes.com/author/ericbuchman/)In [hollywood](https://buchnotes.com/category/hollywood-2/), [television](https://buchnotes.com/category/television/)***

*It’s June, which means TV writers’ rooms for the next season are opening for business.  Most of the people in those rooms are veteran writers who (hopefully) need no advice.  A lucky few are first-time writers who will need a lot of advice, but they’ll get none from me.  (Y’all are on your own.\*)  No, this post is for the other people who make their living in a TV writers’ room; the true, unsung heroes of television. The Writers’ Assistants.*

*(\*Okay, fine, here is one bit of advice for first-time staff writers — don’t feel like you have to prove your worth right out the gate.  Relax.  You got the job over millions of well-qualified writers, so you wouldn’t be there if someone didn’t really believe in your abilities.  Take some time to get a feel for how the room works and do a lot more listening than you do talking for the first couple weeks.)*

*When I say “writers’ assistant,” I don’t mean “assistant to a writer.”  The latter job requires rolling calls, setting meetings, and planning surprise birthday parties for your boss’s spouse and/or boyfriend.  I’m talking about the assistants paid to assist a process, not a person.  Writers’ assistants sit in the writers room, taking notes, conducting research, and providing the writing staff with all the materials/support they need to meet their increasingly tight deadlines.  Most writers’ rooms have between 6-12 writers, but only one writers’ assistant.  In that regard, it’s a pretty hard job to get in it’s own right.  It’s also a hard job to keep.  The process of making a TV series moves too quickly to afford a new writers’ assistant a “breaking in” period.  I hear about more writers’ assistants getting let go because they couldn’t cut it than I do any other job on a TV show staff. (Staff writer is a close second, but I’ll get to that in another post.)  But don’t worry.  If you’re new to the gig, read this, and you’ll be prepared for anything.*

*Note: The advice below pertains to any show with pretty active writers room, which includes all half-hours and most one-hours. If you get a job as a writers’ assistant on a show that doesn’t have a daily convening writers’ room… don’t go crazy with the balloons while planning that surprise party.*

***Okay, I just got a job as a writers’ assistant. Now what?***

*The vast majority of your time will be taking notes.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing is that it puts you squarely in the middle of every discussion that will take place about the content of the show.  The curse is that you will be doing A LOT of typing, and the faster you are at typing, the faster they WILL talk.  Guaranteed.  It’s just one of those mysteries of the universe.  If you take nothing else from this post, it should be this: **nothing disturbs a writer more than looking over and seeing that no one wrote down what they just said**.  You are as much a comfort blanket as you are anything else.  It’s comforting for the writer/producers to know what they just said is on the record somewhere.  Embrace the roll of the blanket (just don’t smother anyone).  Keep your fingers moving while the writers talk.  When I was a writers assistant, I basically took straight dictation. Sure, that means there’ll be a lot of redundant material in the notes as room discussions frequently move in circles, but it’s better than the opposite.  As the writers learn to trust you, you can take your fingers off the keyboard a bit and use more discretion about what really needs to be in the notes, but for your first month or so, err on the side of “more is better.”  Paraphrasing is okay, unless people are pitching specific lines of dialogue, then you’ll want to make sure you get the pitch word-for-word.  Don’t worry about keeping track of who says what.  That’s not your job and, honestly, it’s better you don’t try to attribute any specific ideas to any specific person.  Develop a shorthand if you must, something to remind you what was said so you can flesh it out later, when you have more time.  Do not hesitate to ask a writer to repeat something they just said.  They’ll love that you cared.  Whenever the topic in the room changes — and it can change quickly — put a header in the notes reflecting that:  “Moving onto episode 102…” or “Let’s now talk about all the ways to kill Peter…” or something like that. Put the header in italics, on its own line.*

*Use **bold** to identify things people really, really liked.  And when I say “people” I mean the showrunner.  If the showrunner is in the room, and they toss out an idea, **bold it**.  If someone else says something and the showrunner responds to it, **bold it**.  Always keep your eye on the showrunner, to make sure you’ve noted what they liked.  If the showrunner isn’t there, then look to the person who will be responsible for writing whatever episode is on the table.  Remember, these notes are ultimately for them to refer to when they write their first drafts.*

*At the end of the day, **before you email out the notes, always go through them**.  Typos will be forgiven, but it’s important to make sure the notes are clear and organized.   Hopefully, while taking notes, you used a lot of headers, because that will make it easier to put a **table of contents** on the front page.  Yes, I said table of contents. A good set of notes on a busy day can be 15-20+ pages long, covering a variety of topics over multiple episodes.  You don’t need to be super detailed in the T.O.C., but if the writer for episode 104 wants to only read the notes pertaining to 104, they should know which pages of the notes to turn to quickly.*

*A lot of discussion will be devoted to general ideas for future episodes.  That should be in the notes, but also keep a separate document for these.  There should also be a board in the room dedicated to potential ideas for the future, but I’ll get to the board later.*

***NO, TELL ME ABOUT THE BOARD NOW. I DEMAND TO KNOW ABOUT THIS “BOARD” YOU SPEAK OF.***

*The white boards in a writers room are the writers assistant’s best friend.  **If something is on a white board at the end of the day, that must mean someone really, really liked it.**  Most rooms will have several boards set aside for whatever episode is being broken, another just for future episode ideas, and at least one with a grid showing what’s already been done that season.  When you email out the notes, it’s very handy to include the content of the most current boards.  Yes, you should take a picture of the boards for safekeeping, but do not email out the pictures because they are hard to read (and impossible to search).  Just take the 10 minutes it’ll take to transcribe them. (Note: This is also a good task for an eager P.A.)*

*If you want them to value what you have to say, it never hurts to remind them of good ideas that the room already generated.  If the room is talking about ways to kill a character named Billy via poison, but you remember that last week the showrunner really liked the idea of killing Billy as violently as possible, speak up.  **Become a human archive of all the ideas that anyone liked, and you will be toasted like a king.**  They will want you to talk more, not less.  Instant value, and you didn’t even have to think of anything original\!*

*If you’re taking notes and you just happen to come up with an “awesome idea” you think would help really, really the discussion, wait until there’s a lull before saying anything.  **Make sure not to interrupt anyone.** (That’s advice, by the way, for ANYONE in a writers room. Don’t interrupt people, particularly people who outrank you.)   Or just wait until you have one-on-one time with one of the writers and tell them your idea, if the thought of speaking up in the room is too nerve-wracking.*

*hiatus to work on them.  Make the time during the season.*

# ***On the Fine Art of Researching For Fiction***  

### *Jake Wolff: How to Write Beyond the Borders of Your Experience*

*June 12, 2019*

*The first time I considered the relationship between fiction and research was during a writing workshop—my first—while I watched the professor eviscerate some poor kid’s story about World War II. And yeah, the story was bad. I remember the protagonist being told to “take cover” and then performing several combat rolls to do so.*

*“You’re college students,” the professor said. “Write about college students.”*

*Later, better professors would clarify for me that research, with a touch of imagination, can be a perfectly valid substitute for experience. But that’s always where the conversation stopped. If we ever uttered the word “research” in a workshop, we did so in a weaponized way to critique a piece of writing: “This desperately needs more research,” we’d all agree, and then nothing more would be said. We’d all just pretend that everyone in the room already knew how to integrate research into fiction and that the failures of the story were merely a lack of effort rather than skill. Secretly, though, I felt lost.*

*I knew research was important, and I knew how to research. My questions all had to do with craft. How do I incorporate research into fiction? How do I provide authenticity and detail without turning the story into a lecture? How much research is too much? Too little?*

*How do I allow research to support the story without feeling obligated to remain in the realm of fact—when I am, after all, trying to write fiction?*

*I heavily researched my debut novel, in which nearly every chapter is science-oriented, historical, or both. I’d like to share a method I used throughout the research and writing process to help deal with some of my questions. This method is not intended to become a constant fixture in your writing practice. But if you’re looking for ways to balance or check the balance of the amount of research in a given chapter, story, or scene, you might consider these steps: identify, lie, apply.*

*\**

***Identify***

*I recently had a conversation with a former student, now a friend, about a short story he was writing. He told me he was worried he’d packed it too full of historical research.*

*“Well,” I said, “how much research is in there?”*

*“Uhhh,” he answered. “I’m not sure?”*

*That’s what we might call a visualization problem. It’s hard to judge the quantity of something you can’t see.*

*If you’re looking for ways to balance or check the balance of the amount of research in a given chapter, story, or scene, you might consider these steps: identify, lie, apply.*

*I’ve faced similar problems in my own work. I once received a note from my editor saying that a certain chapter of my novel read too much like a chemistry textbook. At first, I was baffled—I didn’t think of the chapter as being overly research-forward. But upon reading it again, I realized I had missed the problem. After learning so much about chemistry, I could no longer “see” the amount of research I had crammed into twenty pages.*

*Literature scholars don’t have this problem because they cite their sources; endnotes, footnotes, and the like don’t merely provide a tool for readers to verify claims, but also provide a visual reminder that research exists within the text. Thankfully, creative writers generally don’t have to worry about proper MLA formatting (though you should absolutely keep track of your sources). Still, finding a quick way to visually mark the research in your fiction is the least exciting but also the most important step in recognizing its role in your work.*

*Personally, I map my research in blue. So when my editor flagged that chapter for me, I went back to the text and began marking the research. By the end of the process, the chapter was filled with paragraphs that looked like this one:*

*Progesterone is a steroid hormone that plays an especially important role in pregnancy. Only a few months before Sammy arrived in Littlefield, a group of scientists found the first example of progesterone in plants. They’d used equipment I would never be able to access, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, to search for the hormone in the leaves of the English Walnut trees. In humans, aging was associated with a drop in progesterone and an increase in tumor formation—perhaps a result of its neurosteroidal function.*

*My editor was spot-on: this barely qualified as fiction. But I truly hadn’t seen it. As both a writer and teacher, I’m constantly amazed by how blind we can become to our own manuscripts. Of course, this works the other way, too: if you’re writing a story set in medieval England but haven’t supported that setting with any research, you’ll see it during this step. It’s such an easy, obvious exercise, but I know so few writers who do this.*

*Before moving on, I’ll pause to recommend also highlighting research in other people’s work. If there’s a story or novel you admire that is fairly research-forward, go through a few sections and mark anything that you would have needed research to write. This will help you see the spacing and balance of research in the fiction you’re hoping to emulate.*

*\**

***(Two Truths and a) Lie***

*You’ve probably heard of the icebreaker Two Truths and a Lie: you tell two truths and one lie about yourself, and then the other players have to guess which is the lie. I’d rather die than play this game in real life, but it works beautifully when adapted as a solo research exercise.*

*It’s very simple. When I’m trying to (re)balance the research in my fiction, I list two facts I’ve learned from my research and then invent one “fact” that sounds true but isn’t. The idea is to acquaint yourself with the sound of the truth when it comes to a given subject and then to recreate that sound in a fictive sentence. It’s a way to provide balance and productivity, ensuring that you’re continuing to imagine and invent—to be a fiction writer—even as you’re researching.*

*If there’s a story or novel you admire that is fairly research-forward, go through a few sections and mark anything that you would have needed research to write.*

*I still have my notes from the first time I used this exercise. I was researching the ancient Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang for a work of historical fiction I would later publish in One Story. I was drowning in research, and the story was nearing fifty pages (\!) with no end in sight. My story focused on the final years of the emperor’s life, so I made a list of facts related to that period, including these:*

*1\. The emperor was obsessed with finding the elixir of life and executed Confucian scholars who failed to support this obsession.*

*2\. If the emperor coughed, everyone in his presence had to cough in order to mask him as the source.*

*3\. The emperor believed evil spirits were trying to kill him and built secret tunnels to travel in safety from them.*

*Now, the second of those statements is a lie. My facts were showing me that the emperor was afraid of dying and made other people the victims of that fear—my lie, in turn, creates a usable narrative detail supporting these facts. I ended up using this lie as the opening of the story. I was a graduate student at the time, and when I workshopped the piece, my professor said something about how the opening worked because “It’s the kind of thing you just can’t make up.” I haven’t stopped using this exercise since.*

 ***\****

***Apply***

*We have some facts; we have some lies. The final step is to integrate these details into the story. We’ll do this by considering their relationship to the beating heart of fiction: conflict. You can use this step with both facts and lies. My problem tends to be an overload of research rather than the opposite, so I’ll show you an example of a lie I used to help provide balance.*

*When rebalancing the research in my fiction, I list two facts I’ve learned from research and then invent one “fact” that sounds true but isn’t. The idea is to acquaint yourself with the sound of the truth and then to recreate that sound in a fictive sentence.*

*In a late chapter in my book, three important characters—Sammy and his current lover Sadiq and his ex-lover Catherine—travel to Rapa Nui (Easter Island). They’ve come to investigate a drug with potential anti-aging properties that originates in the soil there (that’s a fact; the drug is called rapamycin). As I researched travel to Easter Island, my Two Truths and a Lie exercise produced the following lie:*

*There are only two airports flying into Easter Island; these airports constantly fight with each other.*

*In reality, while there are two airports serving Easter Island (one in Tahiti; the other in Chile), nearly everyone flies from Chile, and it’s the same airline either way. On its surface, this is the kind of lie I would expect to leave on the cutting room floor—it’s a dry, irrelevant detail.*

*But when I’m using the ILA method, I try not to pre-judge. Instead, I make a list of the central conflicts in the story or chapter and a list of the facts and lies. Then I look for applications—i.e., for ways in which each detail may feel relevant to the conflicts. To my surprise, I found that the airport lie fit the conflicts of the chapter perfectly:*

| *Conflict* | *Lie* | *Application* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *Sammy dumped Catherine to be with Sadiq, but he isn’t sure he’s made the right decision.* |         *There are only two airports flying into Easter Island; these airports constantly fight with each other.* |         *The characters all feel torn between two things; they’ve made binary choices they are now reconsidering.* |
| *Sadiq worries that his relationship with high-maintenance Sammy is distracting him from his own career.* |  |  |
| *Catherine left academia for the private sector; the company she works for pays well but is morally dubious.* |  |  |

 

*Ultimately, the airport lie spoke to the characters, all of whom were feeling the painful effects of life’s capriciousness, the way the choices we make can seem under our control but also outside it, arbitrary but also fateful. I used this lie to introduce these opposing forces and to divide the characters: Sammy and Sadiq fly from Tahiti; Catherine flies from Chile.*

*Two airports in the world offered flights to Rapa Nui—one in Tahiti, to the west, and one in Chile, to the east. Most of the scientists stayed in one of those two countries. There was no real meaning to it. But still, it was hard, in a juvenile way, not to think of the two groups as opposing teams in a faction. There was the Tahiti side, and there was the Chile side, and only one could win.*

*This sort of schematic—complete with a table and headers—may seem overly rigid to you, to which I’d respond, Gee, you sound like one of my students. What can I say? I’m a rigid guy. But when you’re tackling a research-intensive story, a little rigidity isn’t the worst thing. Narrative structure does not supply itself. It results from the interplay between the conflicts, the characters, and the details used to evoke them. I’m presenting one way, of many, to visualize those relationships whenever you’re feeling lost.*

*Zora Neal Hurston wrote, “Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.” Maybe that’s why I’m thinking of structure and rigidity—research, for me, is bolstering in this way. It provides form. But it’s also heavy and hard to work with. It doesn’t bend. If you’re struggling with the burden of it, give ILA a shot and see if unsticks whatever is holding you back. If you do try this approach, let me know if it works for you—and if it doesn’t, feel free to lie.*
