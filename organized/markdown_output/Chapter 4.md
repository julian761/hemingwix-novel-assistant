**Chapter 4**

**Scene: The Family Dinner**

The meal was ending in its usual state of stratified peace. From the living room, the shrieks of his sister’s children provided a chaotic, cheerful soundtrack that only highlighted the formal quiet at the table. Irina, Ned’s mother, moved with a practiced efficiency, clearing plates, her movements designed to smooth over the gaps in conversation. At the head of the table, Arkady was a fixed point, his thumb scrolling with slow, precise movements through a technical journal on his phone.

Opposite Ned, his sister Leah and her husband, David, spoke in low tones about swimming lessons. David, a man perpetually treading carefully on the foreign soil of his wife’s family, was Ned’s target. Ned waited, letting the conversation drift until it landed on a complaint about the cost of summer camps. That was his opening.

“Everything’s getting expensive,” Ned said, directing it at David. He kept his tone light. “Funny enough, I’m seeing it from the other side now. I just started a new job, in the dental world.”

David looked up, interested. “Oh yeah? What are you doing?”

Before he could answer, a fork clattered against a plate. It was Arkady’s. He had set his phone face down on the table, an act of finality that sucked the air out of the room. Irina froze for a second by the counter.

“You are not an accountant anymore?” Arkady’s voice was flat, heavy with a Russian accent that always got thicker when he was displeased.

Ned kept his eyes on David, refusing to be drawn in. “I’m still a licensed accountant dad. It’s a business development role, Dad.”

“Business development,” Arkady repeated the phrase as if it were a foreign substance he was tasting for the first time. He looked at his own hands, then back at Ned. “I am a physicist. I build things that protect this country. A dentist,” he gave a small, dismissive nod toward David’s side of the family, “he fixes what is broken. These are professions of value. An accountant… it is a profession at least. It verifies…” 

“We are building something. A business.” Ned said.

Arkady waved a hand in the air. “‘Business development.’ You are a middleman.”

Leah jumped in. “Dad, it’s a fantastic opportunity. It’s a fast-growing company.”

Arkady’s gaze didn't waver from Ned. “Growth... Cancer also grows.” The sting was severe. Arkady had just lost his sister after a short, intense battle with cancer.  “You add nothing. You take from one man, you give to another, and you keep a piece. This is not work. It is… a fee.”

The word hung in the air, an indictment. Ned felt the familiar heat rise up his neck, the old sting of a thousand similar dismissals. But this time, something else was there, too—a cold, hard resolve. He gave his father a tight, half-smiling nod, a silent concession of a battle he had no intention of fighting. Then he turned back to his brother-in-law, his focus absolute.

“Anyway,” Ned said, his voice level, “we’re partnering with dentists who are looking to sell their practices. I was just thinking it might be interesting to get your dad’s take on the industry. Would Harry be open to a quick chat, you think?”

David, who had been staring intently at his water glass, looked up, visibly relieved to have been given a direct instruction. “Oh. Uh, yeah. I can definitely ask him.” He hesitated. “He’s always said he’s ‘not sure about corporate dentistry,’ but I’ll tell him you’d like to talk.”

“Great,” Ned said, the word clipped and final. “That’s all I need.”

He looked across the table. His father had already picked his phone back up. Ned had his lead. 

The next morning, Ned walked toward Zvi’s glass-walled corner office. 

He’d replayed David’s remarks all night, the plan solidifying in his mind. He knocked once on the glass.

Zvi looked up, his face breaking into a politician's practiced smile. “Ned. Come on in.”

Ned kept his voice level, professional. “Zvi, got a minute? I’ve got a live one. Dr. Harry… owns a great little practice in the Beach. Told you about him during the interview: my sister’s father-in-law.” He saw a flicker of interest in Zvi’s eyes and pressed on. “So, I found out he’s wary of the corporate thing, but he’s basically family I can get him over the line. We’re chatting over the weekend.” Ned got ready for the praise. 

Zvi leaned back, the leather of his chair groaning in protest. A slow, pitying smile spread across his face. He let out a short, sharp puff of air—not quite a laugh, more like a puncture.

“Family connection. That’s great, Ned. That’s using your head.” He steepled his fingers, the picture of a magnanimous mentor. “That’s exactly what I told him last night when I called him.”

The air went out of Ned’s lungs. “What?”

“Yeah, he was a little standoffish at first. But I mentioned you—his sister-in-law's brother, right?—and he warmed right up. Said you were a ‘good kid’.” Zvi’s smile widened, all teeth. “We’re hitting the links on Monday. His day off.”

“Harry is my deal now. You slept on it Ned.” Zvi stood and walked around the desk, clapping a heavy, proprietary hand on Ned’s shoulder. “This is your first lesson, Ned. Free of charge. A lead is only yours when the ink is dry. Until then, it’s just information.” He gave Ned a gentle push toward the door. “You brought good information to the team. Not bad for your first week. Watch how I close this. You’ll learn something.”

Ned walked out of the office in a daze, Zvi’s condescending smile burning into his back. 

Zvi called him back in. “Hey, Ned.” Ned walked back in thinking Zvi was about to say he was joking. “We have Ebitda targets to hit. There are a few PE firms kicking the tires. Big ones. They want to see growth. So we have to close deals fast. We need 20 LOIs signed by the end of the quarter. Don’t tell me about a lead and then come back in her to tell me about the same lead. Close deals. Last lesson of the day.” 

Somehow more deflated the second time he left Zvi’s office, he felt the eyes of the junior analysts on him from the bullpen. He was halfway to his desk when a voice cut through the fog.

“Let me guess. You went in with a fish, and came out holding the guts.”

It was Abe, leaning against a filing cabinet labeled “Project Smokeshow”, a coffee mug cradled in his hands.

“He fucking poached it,” Ned said, the words a low, angry torrent. “The whole thing. Used my family connection—he’s golfing with him Monday.”

Abe took a slow sip of his coffee, a conspiratorial grin spreading across his face. It was the most unnerving and somehow comforting thing Ned had seen all day.

“Yeah, that’s the Zvi special,” Abe said. “He’s brutal with the guys. Welcome to the team.” He pushed himself off the cabinet and fell into step with Ned.

They stopped at Ned's desk. Abe leaned in.

“The next time you get a nibble don’t bring it to the boss.” He nodded back toward Zvi’s office. “You bring it to me.”

Ned stared at him, the sting of betrayal still sharp. “And why the hell would I trust you?”

“Because I don’t get a commission,” Abe said, his lopsided smile turning wry. “Which makes me the only person in this whole goddamn circus you *can* trust. My fun is hanging out with the clowns.” He leaned closer. “Look. Zvi knows how to order the right wine. I’m the one who writes LOIS that make them legal. He knows the handshake. And I’ve been studying the BD guys. It’s not rocket science.”

“I’ll think about it. Have you heard about this PE Deal?”

“Yup. Working on the diligence with a team at Watkins. If we can show the numbers, Kent is about to get fuck you rich. The pipeline needs move though.” 

“How do you mean?”

“I mean he’s under orders: close deals at any cost. Even Kent is out there pressing the flesh, and he hates dentists. Thinks they’re glorified plumbers only less interesting.” Abe tapped a finger on Ned’s desk for emphasis. “So, you want to be the guy who feeds the machine, or you want to be the guy who gets paid? Lesson 2…”

Ned asked confused, “He hates dentists?”

Abe tapped a finger on Ned’s desk for emphasis. “You want to bring in a deal that’s actually *yours*? You work with me.”
