### **Chapter 1**

### **Scene 1 (Revised Again)**

**Beat 1 – Opening Image**

The fluorescent hum was a constant, flat line, the sonic equivalent of the office’s beige color palette. It was a good accounting firm—clean, quiet, professional—and utterly soulless. Ned leaned into his monitor, the world shrinking to the spreadsheet. Numbers in neat columns, predictable and clean. Except one. A tiny anomaly, an uptick hidden in an amortization block.

His pen stopped tapping. He didn’t need to double-check the source documents. The subsidiary's assets were logistics machinery, value front-loaded. Booking them straight-line was, to put it politely, an eight percent embellishment of net income. To be less polite, it was a lie. A small, self-satisfied smile touched his lips. Sloppy.

**Beat 2 – Awkward Interaction**

Printout in hand, Ned crossed the grid to Davison’s corner.

"It’s the amortization for the subsidiary," Ned said, placing the paper on the desk. "Straight-line on front-loaded assets. It overstates their net income by eight percent."

Davison leaned in, his brow furrowing with practiced concern. "Eight percent? Let me see—"

"Davey, my man," a voice cut through the air. "Barclay. Infrastructure fund. Jessica Albright."

Kyle materialized at the edge of the cubicle, radiating expensive cologne and the easy confidence of someone who had never been ignored in his life. He held a tablet like a scepter.

"Albright?" Davison’s focus snapped away from the printout, his posture loosening. "From the intern class? No kidding."

Ned stood there, his hand still resting on the corner of the paper.

"She’s at Blackstone now," Kyle continued, grinning. "Running point on their new fund."

"Get her number?" Davison asked, already pulling out his own phone.

Ned pulled his hand back from the printout. "It's a significant misstatement," he said, but his voice was a stone dropped in a fast-moving river. Gone.

**Beat 3 – Yearning**

Back at his desk, Ned watched Kyle walk off with another colleague. There was no hand slap, just an easy synchronicity in their steps, their conversation already a private joke by the time they reached the elevators.

Ned felt the familiar prickle of being on the outside. It wasn't just jealousy. It was a clear, cold assessment. He knew Kyle's golf handicap was a lie, just like his expense reports. These were the guys who got ahead on a frictionless track of private school handshakes and feigned interest. The resentment was there, but it was followed by a more clarifying thought: *If these guys don't see how awesome I am, maybe there's somewhere else.*

**Beat 4 – The Messy File**

A shadow fell over his desk. Davison.

"Right," he said, tapping the forgotten printout. "The lease thing. Good flag. Fire a query to their controller." He dropped a thick folder onto the desk with a dull thud. "New client. Private equity dental start-up. '$miles'r Us.' Full diligence. EOM."

The aggressively cheerful font on the cover sheet was an insult. Ned sighed and flipped it open. The first thing he saw was the bottom line, nestled in parentheses. *Wow,* he thought, *this business is losing a lot of money.*

He spent the next hour doing a preliminary pass, his pen making small, neat ticks in the margins. The story wasn't in the revenue, which was negligible, but in the expenses. They were astronomical. "Practitioner Synergies," "Brand Outreach," and dozens of other vague categories. He paused on one. *Practitioner Outreach & Appreciation Event – Windsor.* He flipped to the supporting documents. *Jesus,* he thought, *that's a lot of expenses for fancy parties.* He kept digging. Invoices from five-star hotels, catering bills that cost more than his car, receipts for things labeled only "entertainment." And there were gaps. Lots of them. *Seems like a lot of receipts are missing, too.* He made a note, his handwriting small and precise.

**Beat 5 – The Close**

Ned leaned back, the leather of his chair groaning in the silence. He looked up. The bustling grid from earlier was now a ghost town of darkened screens and empty chairs. The only sounds were the ever-present hum and the soft whir of his own computer. He glanced at the clock in the corner of his monitor: 9:47 PM. He was the last one here. Again.

He pulled out his phone, the bright screen jarring in the dim light.

**To: Caleb** Still chained to the desk?

**From: Caleb** Always. Keg in 30?

**To: Caleb** See ya there.

Ned closed the '$miles'r Us' folder, leaving it squared perfectly in the center of his desk. He shrugged on his coat, grabbed his bag, and walked out, the motion sensor lights switching off behind him, plunging the office back into darkness.

Ned spotted Caleb in their usual booth in the back corner, a position that offered a decent view of the TVs without having to be in the blast radius of the bar. Caleb was already halfway through a beer, his tie loosened, eyes glued to his phone. He looked up as Ned slid onto the worn leather bench.

"There he is," Caleb said, not looking up from his phone. "Thought they might've chained you to the radiator this time."

"Almost," Ned replied, signaling a server. "Prelim on a new client. A real winner."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the familiar ritual needing no narration. When Ned’s beer arrived, Caleb finally pocketed his phone.

"So, spill it," Caleb said, taking a long drink. "You've got that look on your face. The 'I just found another error in the matrix' look, only it's not the fun kind."

Ned gave a wry twist of his lips. "Productive day. Kyle Barclay floated by to remind Davison that he speaks a language I don't."

Caleb snorted, a flicker of recognition in his eyes. "Don't tell me. Let me guess. Barclay. Infrastructure fund. Jessica Albright."

Ned nodded, impressed despite himself. "Right down to the name. Suddenly my eight-percent amortization error wasn't quite so fascinating. It's like they operate on a different frequency."

"It's not a frequency, it's a trust fund," Caleb corrected him. He leaned forward. "You hear about the Children's Literacy fundraiser thing? The fashion show?"

Ned’s jaw tightened. "I'm apparently the only one in the group who *didn't*."

"Hey, you'd hate it," Caleb said, trying to soften the blow. "A hundred guys who think 'escrow' is a brand of scotch, sweating in tuxes and trying to look good for their wives."

"It's not about wanting to go," Ned said, staring into his beer. "It's the memo. 'You are not one of us.' Loud and clear." He took a long, sharp swallow of beer. "Anyway, fuck 'em. This new client is a bigger joke than they are."

"$miles'r Us," Ned said, shifting gears. "A dental-clinic rollup. The books are a disaster, but what's really insane are the multiples they're paying for new clinics. They're buying up these little one-dentist shops for five, six times what they're worth. Who knew dentistry could be so fun."

Caleb's professional interest was piqued. "Yeah, there's money pouring into those rollups right now. They're all over the place. If you can get a loan to buy a clinic or two—and if you aren't a crackhead—PE will throw money at you. Market's hot down south, looks like it's heating up here, too."

He leaned forward, lowering his voice against the bar's din.

"It's not about the dentistry, Ned. It's a gold rush. It's all about cashing out and flipping to the next bidder. The financials just have to hold together long enough to get the deal done."

Ned stared into his glass, the amber liquid swirling as he moved it. The sloppy accounting, the parties, the absurd acquisitions... it wasn't incompetence. It was a strategy.

"Jesus Christ," Ned said, looking up at his friend. "So I shouldn't waste my time flagging the missing receipts from the 'Practitioner Appreciation Event' in Windsor, then."

Caleb just grinned, raising his glass. "Now you're thinking like a managing partner."

### **Scene 3 – The Hunt**

The Wednesday hum of the office was steady but thin—monitors whispering static, phones murmuring in low bursts, the faint tick of the HVAC vents breathing recycled air. Ned sat at his desk with a coffee that had gone tepid, bitter as aspirin. Caleb’s words from the night before were still in his head, heavy as ballast. *It’s not about the dentistry, Ned. It’s about the flip.*

The $miles’r Us folder sat in the center of his desk like a dare. Yesterday it had looked sloppy. Today, it looked deliberate. Not a mess—something mapped. And maps had destinations.

He didn’t bother with the income statements. Numbers lied. People told the lies. He needed the people.

He left his mug on the desk and drifted toward the capital markets group, a slow detour past the printer. Marcus was coming back from the kitchen, his senior analyst swagger muted under a week’s worth of all-nighters. Ned timed it, falling into step beside him.

"Burning the midnight oil?" Ned asked, lifting his own empty mug in a gesture of silent fraternity.

Marcus didn't break stride. "Midnight, morning, what's the difference?" he grumbled. "Just had an LP torpedo a nine-figure deal. Sent me back to the Stone Age on diligence." He shook his head. "Amateurs."

Ned gave a sympathetic nod, letting a beat hang in the air between them. Then, casually, he dropped the hook. "Tough break. Heard Apex Capital is having the opposite problem."

A short, humorless laugh escaped Marcus's lips. "Apex." He instinctively glanced over his shoulder, a habit born from years of proprietary conversations. "They've got so much dry powder, their limited partners are practically holding a gun to their heads. Let's just say their definition of 'diligence' has gotten… *flexible*." The smirk was half amusement, half disgust. "Right now, they'd overpay for a hot dog stand if it had an EBITDA multiple."

He gave Ned's mug a light tap with his own and kept walking. "Don't let 'em catch you standing still."

That was more than enough. Ned went back to his desk.

The Apex Capital site was corporate boilerplate—overexposed stock images, verbs that meant nothing: *unlock, empower, optimize*. He typed “$miles’r Us” into the search bar.

The results made no sense. No site. No patient locator, no smiling stock families. Just social media. The Instagram account had the logo, but the feed was a rolling highlight reel of a life no dentist he knew had time to live.

Five men, tanned to the same shade, on the deck of a yacht somewhere warm. Caption: *Celebrating our Western Expansion\! \#PractitionerLife \#LivingTheDream.* Scroll. Same men, tailored golf gear in Scottsdale. Scroll. Same men, tuxedos at a black-tie gala, their arms around women half their age.

Not a single patient. Not a chair. Not a set of scrubs. Just proof of wealth, curated for an audience that already belonged.

Ned sat back. The leather in his chair popped. The threads in his mind started knitting without him—Apex’s deal pressure, the overpaid acquisitions, the absurdly vague expense headings in the file. This wasn’t expansion. It was conversion—capital in, personal wealth out. The dental roll-up was a pretext.

He zoomed on the yacht photo. Their grins were too wide, like they’d gotten away with something. He studied them until his reflection began to ghost over theirs in the monitor’s glass.

He didn’t blink.
