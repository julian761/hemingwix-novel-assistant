If you’re like me, you think: writing realistic dialogue shouldn’t be that hard. Especially if I’m writing average, everyday, informal characters. Maybe they’re fantasy characters or historical figures, and then they’re a little special. But otherwise, I’m a person\! I know how to talk\! This should be easy, right? Well, easier said than done.

And if you’re like me, you want a step-by-step breakdown of what it is that makes characters sound less like robots and more like actual people. So that’s what we’re going to do: analyze [dialogue](https://kidlit.com/dialogue-writing) like weirdos—I mean, writers.

*When done right, writing realistic dialogue isn’t simple because people aren’t.*

# **WRITING REALISTIC DIALOGUE**

When done right, writing realistic dialogue isn’t simple because people aren’t. And like real people, characters have entire inner worlds swirling around inside their little heads. Ultimately, those things that affect their language and give you a headache are what will make them more [believable](https://www.goodstorycompany.com/blog/believable-characters).

## **WORDS, WORDS, WORDS**

Let’s get all the way down to the sticks and bricks of what makes a sentence. On the word level, you can start to look at a character’s vocabulary.

Vocabulary will actually tell readers a lot, like whether the character is educated. Depending on whether they say “soda” or “pop,” we can even start to narrow down what region they’re from.

A character can use fancy words to impress people. They can use small words to condescend to someone they don’t like. They’ll probably use different words when talking to their *abuela* than to a classmate (this is a thing called code switching, which usually happens unconsciously).

Maybe they’ve picked up words from hobbies or sports. Some of these words may baffle others, like “dramaturg” or “boffers” or “panty pass.” Slang, abbreviations, and [obscenities](https://www.goodstorycompany.com/blog/swearing-in-childrens-books) can also change word usage.

## **STRINGING SENTENCES TOGETHER**

On the sentence level, different characters will speak for varying lengths of time. Speech patterns come into play here. Is this a character who uses simple sentences and says “um” and “uh” a lot, or a character who tends towards complex, performative sentences?

“I get straight to the point.”

“Whereas I … trail off while I think … occasionally remembering oh yeah did I tell you? I made a sentence today\!”

What do they like to talk about? If they’re uncertain and anxious, maybe they’re the type to meander around their sentences and end in questions..? Or maybe..\! They’re always excited\! And things get *italics* for emphasis\!

(But please, please only use one exclamation point at a time. We get it. They’re excited.)

If the character is aging, they may spend their sentences talking about the good old days. Or if they’re a high school senior, they might be pretty focused on the future. Age isn’t the only factor here. [Personality](https://goodstorycompany.com/protagonist-personality) also plays into what tense a character talks in.

## **… AND WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE**

Just like us, characters can have ups and downs. Excitement or anger can affect how someone talks. A usually quiet character might verbally process a situation when stressed out. Someone may panic over having lost a wallet and suddenly start asking 100% more questions than normal.

All of the above will change according to the category in which you’re writing.

A [picture book](https://kidlit.com/picture-book-writing-style) character will use simpler sentences than an adult fiction character. A [science fiction](https://goodstorycompany.com/science-fiction-tropes) character will use different vocabulary than a weird western character, and so forth.

## **PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS?**

Here we zoom out to writing realistic dialogue. Insert flashing lights here\! Finally, you have built a baseline.

So, here’s the thing.

Most of the time, dialogue in real life isn’t nearly as tidy as it is in a book.

In books, people get to say things as if they’ve spent some time thinking about it. They get to finish their thoughts. People often listen to them. It actually isn’t very realistic at all.

A villainous, self-absorbed character may be so wrapped up in their mustache-twirling that they fail to acknowledge the other speaker. That hero may be trying to speak, but after getting interrupted multiple times, maybe they begin shouting simultaneously.

Even in an unrealistic example, the dialogue can be realistic.

Why? Because messy and complicated \= more realistic.

# *19 Ways to Write Better Dialogue*

*Nov 13* 

*Written By [Kristen Kieffer](https://www.well-storied.com/blog?author=5654c2e2e4b05e28e38344c0)*

*Photo by [Priscilla Du Preez](https://unsplash.com/@priscilladupreez?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/laugh?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

*For years, I struggled deeply with the dialogue in my stories. I didn’t have a natural knack for writing conversations that felt real and true to character, and I let this weakness deter me from striving to improve. But stories need dialogue, and my own was suffering for a lack of attention.*

*Finally, I decided that enough was enough. I began reading every bit of advice on writing dialogue that I could get my hands on. I studied the novels I read, and I rewrote the conversations in my stories again and again, until at last I began to see improvement.*

*More importantly, I came to understand dialogue as the complex literary powerhouse that it is.*

*Unfortunately, it’s this very complexity that can make quality dialogue so difficult to craft. That’s why I’m breaking down nineteen steps for writing better dialogue in today’s article, beginning with ten tips for crafting richer, more nuanced conversations.*

## *\#1: Every line of dialogue must serve a purpose*

*Dialogue shouldn’t exist solely to give your characters something to say.*

*Rather, effective literary conversations serve many powerful purposes; they can explore characters, advance the plot, ramp up tension, reveal context, establish mood, and so on.*

*If you can remove a line of dialogue from your manuscript — or, worse yet, an entire conversation — without impacting readers’ understanding of your story, then there’s a good chance your dialogue lacks strong purpose and direction.*

## *\#2: Don't keep it real*

*Writers are often encouraged to craft realistic dialogue. But in fiction, there is such a thing as too realistic.*

*Just think of all the fluff that fills the conversations in your day: the small talk, the stammering, the simple statements repeated three times before they’re heard. These moments certainly have their place in fiction, but only when the author is trying to make a point.*

*The most “realistic” dialogue isn’t that which mimics the language you hear every day; it’s that in which your characters’ voices ring true.*

## *\#3: Developing voice is crucial*

*Choose three characters from your story, and write a conversation about whether pizza is humanity's greatest food — without using dialogue tags. Would readers be able to tell which character says each line?*  
*“Voice” is a term often applied to the verbal and non-verbal ways a character communicates given their personality, experiences, beliefs, self-esteem, world-view, and cultural influences.*

[*The stronger your characters’ voices, the more authentic their conversations will be.*](https://www.well-storied.com/blog/how-to-define-your-characters-unique-voice)

## *\#4: People don't always say what they mean*

*People are complex creatures. Rarely do we say what we want to say in the way we want to say it. Instead, we tailor ourselves to our surroundings, striving to fit in or stand out, to cut deep, to flatter or appease.*

*It’s no wonder that on-the-nose dialogue can ring so false. Crafting nuanced conversations that take voice and circumstance into account can be tricky, but it’s always well worth the effort.*

##  

## *\#5: Relationships play a key role in conversation*

*Speaking of circumstance, every conversation is shaped by the context in which it takes place, especially as concerns the relationships between your characters.*

*How your lovers talk about the weather should differ from how the same conversation plays out between an estranged father and son, between co-workers or strangers on the street.*

 

## *\#6: Make use of body language and expression*

*People say just as much with their expressions and body language as they do with their mouths. Posture, eye contact, mannerisms, and reactions should all play a prominent role in the conversations your characters hold.*

 

## *\#7: Don't be afraid to get messy*

*Realistic conversations rarely take place in perfect, polite sentences. People are messy, after all — and our dialogue is, too. So don’t be afraid to allow your characters to speak in fragments and unfinished sentences. To eschew grammar and use slang. To curse up a storm.*

 

## *\#8: Balance the players*

*Crafting dialogue between four or more characters can be tricky. Fortunately, it’s rare that so many voices share equal weight in conversation. When writing such scenes, resist the urge to ensure every character speaks just as much as the next. Instead, let the power dynamics play out naturally.*

 

## *\#9: Work with the tension of the scene*

*In fiction, nearly all dialogue exists to create or resolve tension in some way. After all, it’s tension that keeps readers turning pages, eager to discover what will happen next.*

*To ensure your story’s dialogue doesn’t stall your story, pay special attention to the threads of tension in each scene. How can you manipulate tension through dialogue in a way that keeps readers engaged?*

 

## *\#10: You don't need to write every detail*

*Dialogue doesn’t need to play out word-for-word on the page. Often, it’s easier to work mundane details such as greetings or words of acceptance into the narrative — or to simply allow readers to infer these details for themselves.*

*Every word you write has the power to bore readers or slow the pace of your story, so make sure you’re choosing your (characters’) words wisely.*

*With all that said, you should have a strong understanding of how to craft nuanced and engaging conversations. Now, let’s turn our attention to the technicalities of well-written dialogue.*

## 

## *\#11: Ditch unnecessary dialogue tags*

*Dialogue tags exist to clarify who is saying what, with the most common tags being said, asked, and replied. Other common tags (e.g. shouted, whispered, hissed) expound upon how a line of dialogue is said.*

*Dialogue tags are doubtless an important aspect of fictional conversations, but too many tags can also slow the pace of your story — or even draw readers out of your story entirely. Use them with caution and care.* 

 

## *\#12: Said isn't dead*

*The clarity that tags provide is often vital, but bear in mind that dialogue tags are also a sign of authorship (i.e. a narrative element not written in the point-of-view character’s voice).*

*The occasional sign of authorship won’t pull readers from your story if they’re deeply engaged. But the more ubiquitous you can make your dialogue tags, the better. Readers will graze right over words like “said” and “asked” while still registering the identity of the speaker, ensuring your story keeps on flowin’.*

 

## *\#13: Utilize action tags instead*

*Action tags are the small attributive actions that precede or follow a line of dialogue, such as the following:*

*Amanda fiddled with the hem of her shirt. "I don't know if that's the best idea."*

*"Are you sure that's what you really want?" Brad raised a brow.*

*Making use of action tags is a great way to attribute dialogue while also keeping readers engaged and adding motion to the scene.* 

 

## *\#14: Choose strong dialogue tags*

*If you’re going to use a dialogue tag and the tone in which a line is spoken is important to impart, then choose your tags with care. Consider “whispered” instead of “she asked quietly” or “hissed” instead of “he said in a nasty voice.”*

 

## *\#15: Use realistic tags*

*Many writers mistakenly use attributive actions in place of attributive tags — a grammatical error that's sure to drive copy editors up a wall.*

*Here are two examples of attributive actions used improperly:*  
 

*"I can't believe it," Emma gasped.*

*"That's hilarious," Henry chuckled.*

*Unless you're superhuman, you probably can't gasp or chuckle words, yet this is exactly what the above sentences imply. Instead, let's take a look at two ways to properly attribute these lines of dialogue:*  
 

*"I can't believe it," Emma said with a gasp.*   
*Emma gasped. "I can't believe it."*

*"That's hilarious\!" Henry chuckled.*  
*"That's hilarious," Henry said, chuckling.*

   
*See the difference between the two? Your dialogue might not need to be entirely realistic, but your dialogue tags certainly should be.*

*Want to learn how to properly punctuate all forms of dialogue? Give [this post from The Editor's Blog](http://theeditorsblog.net/2010/12/08/punctuation-in-dialogue/) a read.*

 

## *\#16: Cut redundancies*

*Many inexperienced writers also make the mistake of working redundancies into their dialogue. There’s no need to write"'Ugh,' she groaned," or “‘Ha\!” She laughed,” when just one or the other will do.*

 

## *\#17: Avoid name drops*

*People rarely address the person they’re speaking to by name unless they’re greeting one another or trying to get the other’s attention. Yet many writers work their characters’ names into dialogue left and right.*

*“Annie, stop it. You’re making me laugh too hard.”*  
*“You started it, Michael.”*  
*“Maybe, Annie. But you’re killing me here\!”*

*See how false that feels? If such frequent forms of address are common in your character’s culture or serve a distinct purpose in your story, then have at it. But otherwise, such heavy name-dropping will only pull readers out of your story.*

 

## *\#18: Use dialogue to break up narrative*

*Narrative that spans page after page can become taxing to read, no matter how theoretically exciting it might be. Adding a line or two of dialogue can be a great way to give readers' eyes a break, especially if you allow your point-of-view character to engage with or react to the world around them.*

 

## *\#19: Read dialogue aloud*

*Even after putting these last eighteen tips into practice, it can be difficult to tell whether you've written effective dialogue.*

*In my experience, the easiest way to determine whether your characters’ conversations ring true is to read your work aloud. Do your characters sound like themselves? Does their conversation follow a natural flow? If it doesn’t, reading their words aloud is sure to reveal where you went wrong.*  
 

## *Some Basics to Crafting Great Dialogue*

*Here are the first major considerations regarding dialogue in fiction:*

* *Make sure it fits the context and the character.*  
* *No one should sound like anyone else. Unless you have some funny bit about a character mimicking another character, each person should be unique.*  
* *Don’t use dialogue to dump information. All too often writers use dialogue as a way to impart information to the reader. Yes, dialogue is a great way to convey important things related to your plot and backstory. Through dialogue you can nicely reveal the past and character motivation. But when you slip into what is sometimes called “As you know, Bob” dialogue, the reader can tell you are having characters say things they obviously would know already. Those lines smack of “info dump,” put in there for the reader’s benefit. Which is a no-no.*  
* *Don’t tell us things we already know or don’t care about. Many beginning writers make the mistake of needless repetition. They might say something in the narrative, and then have a character speak out loud the very same thing. For example: Mary really hated it when people talked down to her. She looked at George and said, “You know, George, I really hate it when people talk down to me.”*  
* *Avoid “on the nose” dialogue. This means that characters should never simply state exactly what’s on their minds, without nuance or subtext, nor appear to be giving “exposition.”*  
* *Less is more. If you can “say” the same thing with a visual image, action, behavior, or sound effect instead of through dialog, omit the dialogue Trim out extra words, boring bits of info and phrasing.*  
* *Have a specific purpose for what’s being said, and lead steadily to your point. Don’t have random chatting that serves no purpose.*  
* *Try to have dialogue accomplish more than one purpose (not just to convey information). Dialogue can reveal plot points and backstory, create tension, hint at mystery, etc.*

## *Some Technical Suggestions*

*Regarding writing dialogue of any kind, here are some tips to making it flow smoothly:*

* *Don’t go on for more than five or six lines of dialog between characters without making it clear who is speaking. With only two people speaking, after a while it’s hard to keep track of who is talking. Just adding “Mary said” here and there can help avoid confusion. With more than two conversing, it’s essential you make it clear with every line who the speaker is.*  
* *Conversely, don’t use a speaker tag with every line. Remove unnecessary speaker tags. If it’s clear who is speaking, you don’t need one. A narrative tag here or there will suffice. Example: John shook his head. “I really don’t care.”*  
* *Put a character’s speech and action together in a paragraph. Failure to do this causes confusion as to who is speaking. It’s assumed the last person mentioned is the speaker, so if you do not group the speech and action for each character in separate paragraphs, you’ll have the wrong characters speaking your lines.*  
* *Don’t use fancy verbs for speech (speaker tags). Just use said, asked, replied, or answered. Once in a while you might punch with a different verb: “There,” she declared. “I found it.” Speaker tags should be functional and invisible. Readers blip over the word said. And that’s what you want.*  
* *Don’t use adverbs with your speaker tags. You’ve probably heard this, but it’s a good admonition. A good writer will show the intent and emotion in what’s being said and with body language. Instead of writing “‘Go away,’ he said angrily,” write “‘Go away,’ he said, clenching his fists, his face flushing with heat.”*  
* *Read it aloud. You will hear the wordiness or stiffness of dialog by doing this. It helps a lot.*  
* *Use contractions where appropriate. Unless it befits the character to speak without using contractions (it’s instead of it is, for example), be sure to use them.*

##  *Subtext: Don’t Have Characters Say What They Mean*

*First write your scene and have characters say outright what they want and mean. Then go through and change the wording so that they aren’t saying those things. One way you can do this is by having a character talk about something other, while your narrative is revealing she is trying to say something else. Example (Before and After):*

*“John, I’m worried that you don’t really love me.”*

*“Mary, you’re right. I really don’t. But I have to keep up appearances. We don’t want the children to think anything’s wrong.”*

*“Well, that really hurts. I guess I’ll have to just accept that fact and pretend I don’t care.”*

*Okay, I hope you see how unreal this is, even though this is the truth of how John and Mary feel.*

*Here’s the same exchange but with these feelings as subtext:*

*“John, are you listening?” Mary fidgeted, her heart aching at the way he was ignoring her.*

*“What? Oh, sure. Why are you wondering if I love you? Of course I do—how could you think such a thing?” John went back to reading his book, his brows furrowed in concentration. Mary waited for more, but he said nothing else. Then his face brightened. “Hey, what’s for dessert?”*

*“Chocolate cake—your favorite.” She played with her apron strings, then, with clenched teeth, she threw the apron to the ground. “I’ll go get you a piece.”*

*Mary isn’t saying what she really feels, but we can tell by her show of emotion.*

*You can go through and find lines of dialogue that are too direct in telling what a character feels or wants and then have her say something unrelated to what’s important, as a way to cover her feelings.*

*Here are two other ways to craft compressed, essential dialogue:*

1. *Put in moments of silence. Silence implies other feelings and thoughts. When a character pauses, doesn’t answer right away and gives some emotional “tell” with a gesture or expression, that is subtext.*  
2. *Tension can thicken when characters do talk about mundane things but the reader knows there is something very intense going on plot-wise or unspoken between them. Again, the characters’ physical movements, tone of voice, and behavior can belie what they are actually saying.*

*Here is a Before passage by editor Rachel Thomson (from our book [5 Editors Tackle the 12 Fatal Flaws of Fiction Writing](https://amzn.to/2lAd9SJ)). See what you think of this Before passage and how effective the dialogue is, then compare with the After version.*

***Before Passage:***

*Tyler was sitting out front, whittling a branch with a rusted knife he’d found in the desk inside the cabin.*

*“Reese, hey. Out for a hike?” he said welcomingly.*

*“Yeah, Tyler,” she said.*

*“Can’t be easy with your ankle,” he nodded.*

*“It isn’t easy, Tyler. But the ankle’s healing. It’s a workout, getting through the woods on crutches. I’m pretty tired after doing this for weeks, but I hope it will get better soon,” she said.*

*“Y’know, Reese, if you want company, all you have to do is ask,” Tyler said.*

*“Where’s Jacob, Tyler?” she asked.*

*“Off somewhere like usual, Reese,” Tyler shrugged.*

*Overhead, the sky was darkening. Reese looked up and frowned.*

*“Tyler, get inside,” she said worriedly.*

*“What, Reese? What’s going on?” he asked questioningly.*

*“Just get inside,” she said commandingly.*

*“What’s going on, Reese?” he asked persistently.*

*“Would you get inside, Tyler?” she shot back hotly.*

*“No, Reese. I’m going to help you,” he insisted.*

*“Fine, Tyler. But whatever happens, it’s not my fault,” she said with annoyance.*

*Inwardly, she laughed with derision at her own words.*

*Was anything not her fault?*

*The actual dialogue in the passage above isn’t bad. But it has a few key (and common) problems:*

* *The characters constantly address each by name. (In real life, we almost never do this.)*  
* *It uses a speech tag after every line of dialogue, which is wholly unnecessary and oftentimes annoying.*  
* *The speech tags always come at the end of the dialogue, even when that’s awkward.*  
* *It uses adverbs to tell what the dialogue itself is perfectly capable of showing. (Yes, I had to stop myself from writing “he insisted insistently.”)*  
* *The passage doesn’t use action or setting details, so all we have is talking heads in white space. This detaches readers from the scene. It’s also lacking in any inner speech from the POV character, so there’s an entire under-layer missing.*

*Here’s the difference when the above problems are corrected:*

***After Passage:***

*Tyler was sitting out front, whittling a branch with a rusted knife he’d found in the desk inside the cabin.*

*“Hey,” he said, looking up as Reese approached. “Out for a hike?”*

*“Yeah.”*

*“Can’t be easy with your ankle.”*

*Reese laid her crutches aside and lowered herself beside him, using the cabin wall to steady herself. “It isn’t. But the ankle’s healing.”*

*Tyler nodded. “Good.” Then he frowned. “You okay? You look like you just ran a marathon.”*

*“It’s a workout, getting through the woods on crutches.”*

*“Okay.” He seemed less than convinced. “Y’know, if you want company, all you have to do is ask.”*

*She didn’t say the answer that ran through her head. No good. It’s not safe to be with me right now. They’re after me, and I’m not sure why. Better you don’t get yourself killed being in my company.*

*Tyler was a good kid with a good heart, but he had no battle training. She was happiest having him far away while she fought off the attacks.*

*“Where’s Jacob?” she asked.*

*“Off somewhere. Like usual.”*

*Overhead, the sky was darkening. Reese looked up and frowned. Clouds were blocking out the open spaces between the pines—clouds and something else.*

*“Tyler,” she said, “get inside.”*

*“What? What’s going on?”*

*“Just get inside.” She reached for the wall and got to her feet. Tyler jumped up but didn’t make a move to go in. She turned to glare at him and saw a sword in his hand. He held it up.*

*“What’s going on?” he asked.*

*“Would you get inside?”*

*“No. I’m going to help you.”*

*“Fine,” she said through gritted teeth. “But whatever happens, it’s not my fault.”*

*Was anything not her fault?*

*I hope you were able to see the difference and note why and how the second example was better, more masterful.*

*Let’s take a look at a second example, this one from editor and author Robin Patchen (also from our Fatal Flaws book).*

***Before Passage:***

*Walter answered on the second ring. “Walter Boyle.”*

*“Hi, Walter. It’s Rae.”*

*“Wow, Rae. How are you?”*

*“I’m okay, Walter. How about you?”*

*“Oh, it’s been busy. I love my job, though. Working as a reporter for the New York Times was always my dream job, so I’m not going to complain. I haven’t heard from you in months. I’ve been calling and calling, but you never call me back. Where have you been? What’s been going on with you?”*

*“I’m glad you still love your job. I’ve been . . .” She thought of the infant sleeping upstairs. “Busy. Listen, I need a favor.”*

*“Of course you need a favor. You always need a favor. You practically fall off the edge of the world, but as soon as you need something, then you call me. First, you need to tell me what you’ve been up to.”*

*“I really don’t have time to go into all of that right now. And it was awkward, you know, because we were together, and now I’m with someone else. I didn’t know how you felt about that. But still, I really need a favor.”*

 *Lots of problems here. First, we have some telling. They both know he works for the Times. They both know he’s been calling, and she’s neglected to call him back. They both know they used to be together. So why is it in there? To tell the reader? Find a better way, please. Telling through dialogue doesn’t work.*

*Second, we have the banal greetings. Hi. How are you? How long’s it been? What’s new …? If the reader wants to hear all that stuff, she’ll go have a conversation with the clerk at Walmart. Eliminate all the obvious stuff.*

*Finally, this dialogue is “on the nose.” One character says something, and then the next character responds directly to that, saying almost exactly what you’d expect. If the reader can guess what the characters are about to say, I guarantee, the dialogue will be boring.*

*Here’s the rewrite.*

***After Passage:***

*Rae stood in the living room and dialed.*

*He answered on the third ring. “Walter Boyle.”*

*“It’s me.”*

*“Rae? Where have you been? I’ve been trying to reach you for—”*

*“It’s a long story,” she said. “Listen, what can you tell me about the bombing in Tunisia yesterday?”*

*A long pause. “I don’t hear from you in months. You don’t return my calls. You fall off the face of the earth—”*

*“I didn’t. I just—”*

*“You stop sending stories,” he said. “You just disappear.”*

*“Look—”*

*“Where have you been?”*

*“I’ve been . . .” She thought of the events of the previous few weeks, months. There was no time to explain. “Tied up.”*

*“Literally? Because anything less than that, and you could’ve returned my calls.”*

*She paced across the living room. “I don’t have my phone.”*

*“They sell phones on every street corner.”*

*“Look, I’ll tell you, but—”*

*“You married that guy, right?” Walter said. “Moreau?”*

*Rae froze. Swallowed. “How did you—?”*

*“It’s not like it was a state secret.”*

*“No. I know. I—”*

*“You could’ve told me.”*

*She ran her fingers through her hair and paced again. “I should have. It was awkward.”*

*“And this isn’t? You disappear, then call for information like nothing happened.”*

*“I’m sorry.” Rae collapsed on the sofa. “You’re right. I’m just . . . I need your help.”*

*“Don’t you always?”*

*“That’s not fair.”*

*“Is he . . . ?” His voice softened, and he started again. “Is he good to you?”*

*His concern nearly brought tears to her eyes. “You and I have been over for a long time. You ended it.”*

*“Only because I was the only one really in it.”*

*She imagined him then, not just as her conduit to information but as her friend. As more than her friend. She’d blown it with Walter like she’d blown it with everybody she ever loved. “I’m sorry, Walter. I don’t know what else to say.”*

*So what did Robin do here? She deleted all the boring stuff. And because this is a tense scene, sje made the paragraphs short. They’re talking back and forth—not fighting, exactly, but certainly not friendly. There’s enough subtext to keep the reader interested. But the main point of the scene remains the same—she needs information, and she has to deal with his questions before he’s going to tell her anything.*

*You’ll note that Walter has a different goal in mind. He wants to find out where she’s been. So while she’s trying to turn the conversation to her needs, he keeps shifting it back to his.*

*Studying great dialogue will teach you some terrific technique. And, when you think about it, a character’s voice—which flows through every line of a scene’s narrative—is a kind of dialogue and should reflect all the nuances and attributes that would come out in spoken dialogue.*

## *Go through Your Scenes* 

*And look for these culprits that show flawed dialogue:*

*  *Overuse of characters’ names in direct address (“You know, Mary, that I’m right . . .”)*  
* *Using speech tags with every line*  
* *Using flowery verbs for speech tags (“Go away,” she cajoled . . . or extrapolated or interjected)*  
* *Using inappropriate verbs for speech tags (“Go away,” she sighed . . . or groaned or wished)*  
* *Putting a speech or narrative tag at the end of a long passage of speech identifying who is speaking instead of placing it close to the beginning*  
* *Using flowery [adverbs](https://www.livewritethrive.com/2015/11/23/oh-those-lovely-adverbs/) to tell how the words are being spoken instead of showing the emotion (“Go away,” she said angrily)*  
* *Having all your characters sound alike, even though they have different personalities, backgrounds, and cultural influences*  
* *Using “on the nose” dialogue, which means saying exactly what a character feels and which isn’t very believable*  
* *Padding scenes with a lot of unnecessary discourse such as boring greetings*  
* *Lack of contractions in speech of characters that would use contractions in conversation (as well as in the narrative and internal dialogue in POV)*
