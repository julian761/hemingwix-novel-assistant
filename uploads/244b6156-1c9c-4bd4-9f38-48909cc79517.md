**Prologue**

His bomber jacket—$miles’r Us in smug embroidery—was still on, unzipped. His jeans, designer and overpriced, were puddled around his ankles, exposing legs so hairy they looked like they’d been knitted. The hotel bathroom mirror forced him to look at himself. For a second, as he looked at the scene in the mirror, a look of disgust crossed his face. He suppressed, whatever it was, and began to grunt and thrust harder. His hair, naturally thick and curly, had been bullied into submission with what had to be an entire jar of pomade, now starting to sweat loose. The petite escort, who couldn't have been much older than twenty-one—makeup covered cheeks flushed, lipstick blurred—kept whispering his name in his ear, a sing-song repetition. He looked annoyed and distracted, as he gripped the sink for balance, knowing that in three minutes, now two minutes he’d be talking about market share, revenue per visit and stock price to a ballroom full of people.

When it was over, he peeled himself off her like a damp rag and handed over a fistful of hundreds without looking. She tucked the bills away, still perched on the counter, with a smile that was maybe professional, maybe personal. He turned to the mirror, water hissing into the sink as he splashed his face, watched sweat and grime streak downward. The cocaine was quickly poured on the counter, he used his lanyard to quickly slide it into a line. That’s when he noticed the tiny green glow at his collar—the mic was on. Somewhere out in the ballroom, sound techs were hearing all of this. He stared at it for a beat, shrugged, bent down, and inhaled the line with a voracious snort. Jacket zipped, lanyard flopping back into place, he tugged his jeans up, buttoned them, and shouldered the bathroom door into the noise.

The bathroom door closed behind him and the corridor was still, almost serene. Dim sconces lit the carpet in short, uneven pools of light. He passed a catering cart left to fend for itself, steam long gone from the chafing dishes. A half-filled glass of red wine perched at the edge—he grabbed it, tilted it back, and drained it before setting it down with a hollow clink. A woman in a blazer and headset brushed past without meeting his eyes, her voice low and urgent into the mic clipped at her collar.

Then he stepped into the ballroom’s side entrance and the sound hit—cheers swelling like an incoming tide. He wove through the shadows toward the stairs, the noise rising with each step. In the dark, he climbed quickly, feeding on the roar, feeling his chest lift with that chemically braced confidence. But at the top, the spotlight slammed into him—white, merciless, erasing the room beyond. The cheers fractured, fell away, leaving only silence and heat. And in that instant, something inside him cracked.
